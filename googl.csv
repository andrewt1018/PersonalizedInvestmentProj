Well after the ECB still proceeded with a 50bps hike many would have thought that SPY would have a negative reaction today..

The big banks have stepped in an collectively along with the feds to basically prevent FRC from failing… this has officially become much like CS a “too big too fail” moment. Now whats interesting here and many are missing is that yes $2 trillion… yes trillion.. could be injected into the economy essentially to keep the banks from going under but this is a loan. This is not as easy as just printing free money… however, SPY today clearly heard “free money” and literally ran with it all day long. 

Tomorrow is quad witching day (this year is absolutely flying by!)… and with that we should absolutely expect some volatility. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oe0lbrp7e6oa1.png?width=523&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=541e26eea7960d9852473d5c5aeb5bab3e5ed0c4

With an average open of -0.98% on quad witching days… and with this in my opinion artificial run up today… I honestly would have been very tempted to run some over night puts. However, the option chains is absolutely weird right now… 

For instance, tomorrow (at market close) a 1dte call is about 0.98 while an atm put is 2.76… that’s over double of a difference. This mostly is related to the fact that call IV is only 18% and put IV is 35%... I do not really remember a time I have seen IV this different. 

Even looking at the 4 and 5 dte puts are nearly 2x of calls and that mostly is related to IV being nearly double on puts vs. calls. 

This tells me right now that the MM is heavily protected to the downside and the upside is a cheap hedge right now. 

I would expect to see this option chain correct itself in the near future here… IF the bank run issues are truly subsided. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1jqj8488e6oa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1e1530de070fe5944c8d85580562bc63f0f0527e

As I had said as long as bulls held 385.87 with the newly established demand (support) our upside target really should have been 394.68. Well today bulls officially pushed and took out that previous demand (was resistance). 

This now makes our daily chart WIDE open… we have a huge basically $20 trading range from 385.87 to 405.17. Current trend is up and realistically until we get a new supply (resistance) put in then we turly should be looking for an upside push to 405.17. Normally I would say theres no way we hit that tomorrow… however, the fact that SPY has put in its 4th $10 range day in the last 6 trading days its actually fully within possibilities that we hit that level tomorrow… 

Now in the chances that we reject here at the daily 20ema and double top and close red tomorrow there is a very good chance that this 396.2 will become a new supply (Resistance) and that would lead me to believe a retrace back to 385.87 is coming, at least until a new higher demand (Support) is established. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w3kzt8r8e6oa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d8c78cdf16525d1ccb2bd234f9f1e2734a4addca

Cleaned up our chart here a little bit… we broke through the falling wedge I had mentioned yesterday. We also more importantly broke out and closed over that 391.8 black channel resistance. This should as supply/ demand also mentions be an upside breakout trend. 

With the bulls finally reclaiming a close over the daily 8ema for the first time in 8 trading days… we should look for the bulls to close over the daily 20ema tomorrow. That would also signify further upside to be expected. 

IF you look here there actually that similar 385.8 to 405.2 channel that the supply/ demand shows. There is definitely a case and expectation that we could test 405.2 before we see a new resistance put in. 

However it also should be noted that since February 2nd we have been in a clear downtrend. The ultimate bull target for market close tomorrow is a closure over 400 to retake the daily 8, 20, 50, 100 and 200ema. That would in my opinion solidify (outside of new bad banking news) a breakout to 405+ leading into FOMC. Bears tomorrow ultimately going into the weekend need a closure back under 390.1 ideally and minimally back under 391.8 (daily 8ema). 

SPY Levels:  
 Supply- 405.17 -> 414.13  
 Demand- 385.87 -> 376.67  
 Daily support- 394.7 -> 391.8 -> 390.1  
 Daily Resistance- 396.1 -> 397.8 -> 399.7 -> 401.6

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Futures called this upside shot before SPY did but with 3895 holding as demand (support) until a new supply (resistance) is established realistically we should be looking for a push to 4055 supply (resistance). 

Until we tag 4055 or establish a new lower supply (resistance) we should continue to expect an upside push on Futures. Futures did however close over its daily 20ema which also signifies upside potential tomorrow. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

The more I look at this the more I actually see a potential large daily bear flag. If you follow the red resistance line down as long as bears can hold under that line and if they potentially can turn tomorrow into a double top off 3995 then we actually could see downside into next week. However, if the bulls close over 3995 tomorrow and especially if they can close us over 4013 then I truly do expect upside into next week. 

The bulls finally broke us out of that black channel and closed us over that and the daily 8/20ema. We however did hit a brick wall at 4000. 4000 if you look at the chart is definitely a major pivot point. If the bulls can close us over 4000 tomorrow that really should open up a push back to 4055-4095. However, if the bears can hold futures under 4000 at close and turn this into a double top I would target a retest of 3955.

Bulls minimally want a closure over 3970 tomorrow but ideally would like a closure over 4020. If the bears can break this back under 3955 tomorrow that would be an important level to signify possible downside for next week. 

Futures level:  
 Supply- 4055 -> 4160  
 Demand- 3895 -> 4095  
 Daily Support- 3975 -> 3955 -> 3920  
 Daily Resistance- 4000 -> 4020 -> 4055

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5s9slebae6oa1.png?width=834&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dce1835ab45f12df79c43cab4c68888dfde4b04c

The VIX continues to have extreme volatility and movement. For most of the day the VIX was able to hold that key 23.65 support level. However, by EOD it lost that support and now has closed back under its daily 8ema. Last support is at the 22 level which is the daily 20ema. However, with this bearish engulfing VIX candle this truly unless we get another double bottom is a bullish omen for the markets as a whole. 

As much as I do like downside and do believe that we wont see the 420s for a while… this black swan event has significantly fizzled out and for now is not going to be enough to take us down all the way. 

**DXY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/atituwqae6oa1.png?width=856&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f55209c69e364b6811354215887b3512758c1875

The dollar really didn’t do a whole lot of anything today… it just sort of fizzled around. However, it should be noted that it did not break through that 104.6 level but it also did not break back under the 104.3 support area. 

As you can see much like SPY there is a breakout triangle here on DXY… last time DXY/ 10YR set up a pattern with SPY when they broke SPY followed… keeping a close eye here on DXY to see which way it goes. 

**10YR YIELD**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4fnwex4ce6oa1.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dd8e0c1d3cd3928acd675138815a9f1638086319

The 10YR is finding “support” as in we have finally found a level mostly on SPY and a level of fear that people would rather take a risk in the markets then they would in bonds. 

This shows me today and I mentioned this is what happened on Tuesday also that the “fear” unwound and people left the safety of the bond market. Now the interesting thing here is that the very next day as you can see fear immediately spiked. So while we have now put out the first for Credit Suisse and now apparently FRC… there are many banks left that are still not in a good place. I actually would not be surprised tomorrow to see the 10yr rate drop again due to some new fear. 

This 3.39% area is where even back to January and February we seem to see the pivot from safety back to risk on. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xqsag6pce6oa1.png?width=325&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d89c4e89d744572a492881eafed1fcafd1574abc

I actually talked about this a little bit yesterday but I mentioned that TECH as a whole looked incredibly stronger than SPY looked. Why is that? Well in my opinion people think tech is beaten down over the last year. People thing that “big tech” is too big too fall and that there is safety in TECH. Now is a company like Apple, Msft, or google going to go out of business? Absolutely not (probably) as long as the CEO doesn’t do something absolutely stupid… 

However, are these companies “fool proof” and “recession proof?” Absolutely not. For instance, the last true recession in 07-09 the Nasdaq actually fell 56% and SPY fell 57%. Which is quite interesting because year to date through end of February the NASD is actually up 9.5% compared to 3.7% for SPY. 

Who has more room to fall in a true market crash/ recession? 

Now some more perspective here is that 10 years post the 07/09 recession Apple was up 900%, Amazon 2000%, MSFT 400% and even Netflix was up 5000%+. So in a way it does make sense to see people pile into these tech giants because well some day they’ll get their investment back.. however, its like they always say… tech is the last domino to fall… This sudden rush to tech very well could be the final signal. 

For now it appears we have avoided the black swan and financial collapse of 2023… however, like anything nothing happens immediately and its never straight down… ive said since 2022 that the bottom (outside of a black swan event) is likely in and I have also said we are unlike to see any significant new 52 week high until at least 2025.

https://preview.redd.it/532l9c7de6oa1.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=716440a70d8cf3ae8c56664b8f396bf313f29049

Honestly today was just an annoying trading day. Just ended up trading against myself and catching every stop loss hunt it seems. I wasn’t able to rid any of that massive ride up from 1015 to 1145. I attempted to time a reversal only to get stopped out. 

From there I was able to grab quite a few small wins and at one point had even crawled myself back to breakeven. Only to get stop loss hunted twice on calls. 

Days like today (and really yesterday) are highly frustrating for me to trade. Today was not a technical based rally it wasn’t even momentum it was algo fueled FOMO pushing us higher on “good” news. Days like the last two days are nearly impossible to trade well (at least for my established and well tested strategy) because it does not truly follow technical. 

Was there money to be made? Yes… did I have some wins? Absolutely. But I honestly woulda been better off just stopping after my first two trades of the day when I saw that massive 1015 to 1145 am rally and realized what type of day we were going to have…

One thing that I always preach is that we do not have to trade every day. We also do not have to trade every single set up. If you have a well established strategy that you have tried in numerous markets… you learn the limits of that strategy. For me today I knew I was pushing my limit of my strategy. While I did put in a small red day I have had a good enough rest of the week to make up for it and still look to close out another green week. 

However, one thing I definitely recommend is if you can tell… which I mentioned very early on that I knew this was going to be a tough day to trade for my strategy/rules… there is nothing wrong with taking the day off. Remember there are 252 trading days in a year.. you are better off walking away with a small loss or even net zero day versus over trading and putting yourself in a position that will take longer to recover and get back into the green.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11t839r/incognito_qe_and_quad_witching_day_31623_spy_es/,"The reason puts are much more expensive than calls is because tomorrow is ex-dividend on SPY (dividend is 1.78);;The Irish won't be the only thing green tomorrow!;;I think FOMC is going to bring us down, JPow will have to address the FED balance sheet rebound and it’s impact on inflation.

5,wallstreetbets,AMD is going to Rock itself to 100 and beyond,Discussion,"AMD is all set for a major jump to the 100s with every cloud vendor Google, Microsoft and Oracle writing FAT checks for the same.

This along with their supply to PC /Gaming lines is really adding to their topline and bottom-line respectively.

Strong market position: AMD has been gaining market share in both the CPU and GPU markets. Its Ryzen and EPYC processors have been well received by consumers and businesses, and its Radeon graphics cards have been competitive with Nvidia's offerings.

Ryzen processors introduced new levels of performance and value to the desktop CPU market, and its EPYC processors are making inroads in the server market. Good diversification of chips portfolio with CPUs and GPUs

One weakness is :  
AMD relies heavily on a few key customers, including Dell and HP, for a significant portion of its revenue. Losing one or more of these customers could be detrimental to its business.

Partnership opportunities: AMD has partnered with major players in the tech industry, including Microsoft and Google, to develop custom processors for their needs. More such partnerships could be in the company's future.

Competition: Intel and Nvidia are formidable competitors in the CPU and GPU markets, respectively. They have greater resources and established brands, which could make it difficult for AMD to gain market share.

Like yeah for sure they prioritized the tax payers and the overall economy over their friends in their mansions in Santa-Clara.

&#x200B;

But let's look at it for realzyy. First of, here are the [deets](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/monetary20230312a1.pdf):

https://preview.redd.it/yju025sakina1.png?width=1866&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7cc26332653ad8081e9388216f2d9be0ac8ff52a

So yeah no limitations and the rate is the one-year overnight index swap rate plus 10 basis points. Also the rate is fixed on the day where the exchange starts. Mommy and Daddy don't like it when their kid get variable rates. That's only for poors. It's cool it makes the maths easy.

&#x200B;

So, you're regarded and you ask: what's the one-year overnight index swap rate? You asked chatgpt but the guy is telling you to get rektd because

>""I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time financial data. You can check the current one-year overnight index swap rate on financial news websites or by contacting your bank or financial advisor.""

But yeah they have chatgpt with bing nowadays and that gives you the wrong rate. So yeah put on MSFT and fuck the AI hype.

https://preview.redd.it/1v5uvn04mina1.png?width=2312&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8639e69d04b7d3212af5f80588b8abddc15992fb

A good ol google yahoo search like all old people gives Reuters which gives a different value for the rate and they quote Refinitiv Data: 4.9%

https://preview.redd.it/d9lhk350qina1.png?width=1740&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0577bd3c44f40656acc8eee0b086a4f70c0c416b

So we'll take 5% for the loan rate. Which remember kiddos... The rate will be fixed.

Now here please witness the indredible maths:

&#x200B;

1000 USD par value for a 10 year bond can be exchanged today for 1000 USD of cash and the promise of paying 1050 USD back in 1 year (1000 \* 1.05 = 1050, like I said it's high flying stuff). 1057$ if we take last week number from the Reuter article.

&#x200B;

Now you have 1000 USD what can you do with it?

https://preview.redd.it/4lh9f6ngsina1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c48b5d657dc40be937fd764ec5fbb6ed060e519b

That's right buy some freaking treasury bonds.

&#x200B;

Now some among you are smart regards and they noticed that 4.7% is below 5%, meaning you'd take a loss by doing that. That yield is annualized, not what you would get in just three months.

But that's not it!! 

The original bond that you used as a collateral still belongs to you. And as such its coupons should still be paid out to you. It could be that the fed decides to take that coupon because why the fuck not but they haven't released further details than what's above. So we don't know. But if they don't a bank using that BFTP would still cash in their shit 1% rate from 2 -3 years ago when they bought the bond on top of being able to park the cash in short term treasuries.

&#x200B;

But don't worry it's not a bailout. It's actually a hand out. Very different.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11qcbzn/btfp_money_glitch_in_number_with_actual_positions/,">It's not a bailout because the banks are still making money. They're just being given free money to park in short term treasuries. It's a handout, not a bailout.;;Can you not just buy more bonds with the loan?

Does this not just mean all treasury bonds need to have the same rate? Any rate higher than 1 year would be arbitrage;;>The original bond that you used as a collateral still belongs to you.

Jesse what the hell are you talking about?!? You gain nothing by going to the Fed and borrowing at a 5.0% rate and investing the loan at 4.7%, just because you have the original 1% coupons. 1% minus 5% plus 4.7% is less than 1% you dimwit. The ""money glitch"" as you call it is just collecting the interest on the original bond.

The reason why the BTFP exists is because banks might needs cash instead of bonds because depositors are withdrawing money."
7,stocks,Free Resources for Research,Resources,"Hey Gang,

I saw a post not too long ago talking about articles and information behind paywalls, so it gave me the idea to post a list of all the free resources I use when researching and what I use them for. These are in no particular order, I am just copy/pasting them from my own bookmarked folder, so sorry if it feels like I'm jumping around a bit. Enjoy!  


* [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) \- Basic stock/ETF information, financials going a few years back, historic performance, dividend and split history available on the chart.
* [Macrotrends](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/research) \- More in depth financials with many stocks going 10+ years back, can break it down either annually or quarterly. Also hovering over each line item will produce a chart so its easier to comprehend the data. Can also look at historical interest rates, inflation, certain commodities, mortgage rates, etc.
* Seeking Alpha (can't post the link cause the mods got mad at me) - Can be informative to read opinion articles of what others are saying about a stock/fund, especially around earnings time. Obviously use caution because there are a lot of idiots that are allowed to write on this website. Seeking Alpha also usually publishes earnings calls transcripts for most stocks. Emphasis on usually and most lol. I only have a free account but once I run out of free articles I am usually able to put the link to an article through a paywall remover (**SEE 12ft Ladder BELOW**). I find it beneficial to have the app with at least the stocks I own set as a watchlist so I get price/earnings alerts. For someone who doesn't pay the most attention to the markets on a daily basis it is really helpful.
* [Slickcharts](https://www.slickcharts.com/) \- Metrics on certain indices. I don't use this one often but sometimes I like to see where the weights are of different companies in the S&P 500. If you're looking for a certain company on the list you can CTRL + F to search for that stock. Also if you're doing any sort of experiment/backtest and need a random stock you can google a random number generator 1-500 and go to that number in the S&P 500.
* [Finviz](https://finviz.com/map.ashx) \- Index maps, bubble charts, screeners. Can break it down by sector, industry, certain dividend yield, certain payout ratio, etc. All free. You could upgrade to premium but I don't really see a point tbh. Also if you screen you can sort by custom metrics.
* [dqydj.com](https://dqydj.com/calculators/) \- Almost any backtesting calculator you could ever want. You can put in starting amount and even recurring contributions if you so choose. I see a lot of people recommending portfoliovisualizer for backtesting. I honestly haven't tried it because I don't do a lot of backtesting (yknow that old saying, something about past performance and future results), but if portfoliovisualizer works better for the crowd then by all means ignore this one.
* [Multpl](https://www.multpl.com/sitemap) \- A lot more index metrics. I use this one more than Slickcharts when looking at historical market metrics. Pick your poison I guess.
* [Open Insider](http://openinsider.com/) \- I think a lot of people know about this one. Basically just compiles every Form 4 for every public company. All insider buys/sells as they are reported. I had used a couple different websites prior to hearing about Open Insider, but I exclusively use this one now. It's the best that I've seen for insider trading information.
* [Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/) \- I basically only use them for the occasional earnings call transcript that I can't find elsewhere. I personally think their opinion articles usually suck and don't get me started about ""THIS STOCK COULD 10X IN THE NEXT 3 DAYS BUY NOW BEFORE ITS TOO LATE"" lol.
* [CAGR Calculator](https://cagrcalculator.net/result/) \- I use this for looking at average historical growth. Could be anything, earnings, dividends, stock price, etc. Just kinda one of those I like to keep open when researching so I don't have to break out the TI84+ lol.
* [Dividend Growth Calculator](https://dividendathlete.com/dividend-growth-calculator/) \- Got this one from Dividend Athlete on Instagram. Not terrible content (kinda generic at times but what are you gonna do) so give him a follow if you so choose. Regardless, you can put in expected dividend growth, starting yield, and starting amount etc. The output is final portfolio value and dividends received every year, both with and without reinvestment. Kinda neat to see.
* [ETF.com](https://www.etf.com/) \- Compiles a bunch information on a bunch of ETFs all in one place. Could be easier to compare between different funds as well.
* [ETF Database](https://etfdb.com/etfs/) \- ditto
* [GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/new_index/) \- Some more basic stock information. I use this one most for looking at ROIC if the company does not mention it in their own releases. I have a free account that only gives you so many tickers per day or however they measure it, but going into an incognito window usually gets rid of the problem fairly easily.
* [Dividend Value Builder](https://dividendvaluebuilder.com/dividend-kings-list/) \- A while ago I was doing a lot of research/backtesting on the Dividend Kings. I found this list to be mostly complete and among the most accurate. There are still errors (VFC is still on there, Rest In Peace soldier), but fairly accurate nonetheless. I've also talked to the guy that runs the page before via email. Cool guy, got back to me fairly quickly.
* [Dividend Growth Investor](https://www.dividendgrowthinvestor.com/p/dividend-kings.html) \- Basically ditto to previous. Some more historical information as well. I believe this page also has a lot of blog posts so feel free to read those at your discretion.
* [David Fish Dividends List](http://www.tessellation.com/david_fish/) \- For those that really want to go above and beyond, these are the mostly lists of Dividend Kings and more, published by the guy who came up with the term Dividend King in 2007. He died in 2018. This man inspired a generation without knowing it, and yet barely anybody knows him. Next on my to-do list is to find his grave so I can pay my respects /s.
* [SEC EDGAR](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html) \- For those that don't know, every public company must publish basically all official documents to the SEC and they legally have to be publicly available to all investors. Here where those bad boys end up. Punch in a ticker and let your heart run wild.
* [alreits](https://alreits.com/) \- Basic information on a bunch of REITs all in one place. Can be good for sorting/comparison.
* [List of Preferred Stocks](https://stockmarketmba.com/listofpreferredstocks.php) \- ditto, but with preferreds instead of REITs.
* [Briclayer](https://briclayer.com/publications/) \- More REIT information/publications. I bookmarked them a long time ago but looks like they haven't published much since October. Could still be interesting to read some of the articles. Looks like they also have a basic list of REITs.
* [Bond Lookup](https://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/bonds/search?ORDER_BY=TURNOVER&ORDER_DIRECTION=DESC) \- Took this idea straight from Peter Lynch. Sometimes I look at bond prices to judge the credit risk of a company (We got CVNA bonds selling as low as 28 cents on the dollar lol). Maybe it's just me but I couldn't find any normal website like Yahoo Finance to look at prices so I present to you all, Borse Frankfurt. Sometimes it can take a while to load and I think it's technically in euros lol but the concept is still the same. Type in your company of choice, click it, hit Start Search.
* [12ft Ladder](https://12ft.io/) \- Removes **MOST** paywalls. If you have a website where there's a paywall to read an article you saw, copy the entire URL and paste it into this website. This website is why I don't pay for stock research.
* [Compound Interest Calculator](http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm) \- I'm sure you all have your compound interest calculator of choice. This is mine. Nothing special, just figured I'd throw it in.
* [Moody's](https://www.moodys.com/) \- A friend tipped me off to this one. If you are a student or know a student, most school emails work to get you basic access to Moody's. I mostly look at present and historical credit ratings. I think you may be able to get some recent rationales on the ratings with the limited student account, but don't quote me on that. I also haven't tried putting Moody's through 12ft Ladder, so feel free to try that if you're feeling adventurous.
* [Conference Call Transcripts](http://www.conferencecalltranscripts.org/) \- This website also seems to have a lot of free earnings call transcripts, and it seems like its kept pretty up to date contrary to some other websites that may only have calls from a year+ ago (looking at you Motley Fool).

That's what I got! Like I said, I've never paid for stock research and quite frankly I don't believe in it. The big analysts with their fancy Bloomberg terminals have no advantage over the little guy as long as you know where to look. Remember, Google is your friend.

Happy Investing!

\- Bfish",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11uz65q/free_resources_for_research/,"If you can get past all the noise, I think Twitter is an excellent place to get research on particular tickers. I'm not talking about the most popular FinTwit accounts who doompost macro charts without context, shill meme-coins, or farm engagement for their Substacks / private trading communities. You can find honest, detailed DD on tickers from people who have been following companies for years; who regularly communicate with Investor Relations; that have worked/traded/invested in the space before.

Second, with the similar caveats, I find that Seeking Alpha is decent, but only in particular cases. Anything under 'Trending Analysis' is probably clickbait/garbage and I'd avoid. It's either trying to catch retired folks in yield traps or being alarmist about some big tech stock. However, S.A. does an excellent job of getting breaking news on individual tickers, and along with Twitter, is the quickest way to find out if anything happened with your portfolio. Further, not all analysis is bad: again, for those lesser known individual stocks, you can occasionally find some thoughtful articles.

Some warnings about S.A.: often you'll find a sudden flurry of articles on a particular ticker. This is by design: the editors put out incentives for writers to discuss particular stocks, presumably based on the news. So if suddenly you see 30 articles on MPW, this is calculated. Additionally, you will occasionally find outright incorrect misinformation due to limited quality checks. However, usually the commenters do a decent job of catching it.

For both of these, I am assuming you want to read more about a stock and are not simply looking for tickers to dump money in without doing further due diligence.;;Many libraries have online access to D&B, Morningstar, and/or others with a library card.;;Thanks.

Another data charts site I like is the St Louis Fed site:

https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2019/06/comovements-in-monetary-policy/?utm_source=series_page&utm_medium=related_content&utm_term=related_resources&utm_campaign=fredblog;;Finviz should be right at the top of the list, IMO. It's a wonderfully minimalist site jammed with all kinds of data. I made a custom browser shortcut to pop over to any ticker (e.g. ""fv msft"") there -- easy way to get some basic information on a company, plus its chart, in seconds.;;Should consider adding roic.ai to the list imo. It's probably my favorite site for taking a quick look at a company's overall financials. I'm not sure there are any free sites out there that go back further in terms of historical data. But even if there is, its hard to beat the amount of data the site provides in a quick and clean format.;;I used to have the 12ft extension on Chrome but it stopped working for most sites. I didn't know there was a place to copy and paste a link into. Thanks!;;Nice! Ty for the resources!;;Instead of a CAGR Calculator, why not use an [ROI Calculator](https://www.chooseinvesting.com/calc/return-on-investment/)? It calculates the CAGR but also gives total ROI and Average ROI.

Other than that good list and thanks for sharing!;;Why don’t you just use a Bloomberg terminal lmao;;Great list!

Credit Suisse buyout imminent.;;Do you think oil price will keep falling? It seems like  the market view is a bit split here. Tech stocks is rising as if the market is about to bloom again. Whereas bank and oil stocks are falling af like the recession is coming soon;;Ben Felix recently had a video on international diversification that I recommend checking out. He does more than just repeat the mantra that past performance doesn't predict future performance, like many cases for international performance do. [Here is a recent Ben Felix Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/benjaminwfelix/status/1632884241145970690) summarizing his points. Let me give my qualitative summary:


- You're better off geographically  diversifying *within* a single industry than diversifying across industries *within* a single country. 
- Although a large portion of the S&P 500 is composed of multinational firms with global revenue, there are *still* diversification benefits to owning international index funds. [And to add, you're missing out on foreign companies who benefit from US revenue flowing abroad]
- The previous point is especially valid for subsectors like international small cap value (which I tilt via AVDV). The previous points claims that a company like Nestle or Novartis will add diversification benefits to existing US multinationals like Pepsi or Pfizer. But  highly insulated small caps around the world are even more uncorrelated to these US companies. Similarly, US small cap value stocks are useful in volatile moments because they are less exposed to foreign exchange shocks or geopolitical risk.
- Much of the outperformance in US stocks is due to valuation changes as opposed to fundamentals. 
- Ben Felix wouldn't approve, but you can also make market timing arguments about the cheapness of international (and value and small cap) stocks. Ex-US stocks have substantially underperformed in recent years, so you're effectively buying the dip. There are also currency tailwinds since you can buy more with a strong USD.
- Some might claim that ex-US stocks are cheap for a reason. The market timing case argues that they are not just cheap compared to US stocks, but that the discounts themselves are at historic levels. The same applies to small cap or value stocks, which are at the 98th percentile of cheapness. Yes, the UK/Japan/etc. will always trade at a discount to the US, will it always be *this* much of a discount? As previously mentioned, US stocks outperformed by getting more expensive rather than by out-growing  their EPS. Ex-US stocks have the reasonable EPS growth without the valuation premium.

Diversifying will therefore increase your risk adjusted performance.

I think Japan is evidence QE may possibly work at the zero lower bound without really bad inflation as a necessary consequence.  It seems reasonable critics of the Fed do not disagree with that.  

What they object to is why do central banks have massive balance sheets way past the emotional panics that cause credit crunches?  Not only does there seem to be a lack of evidence of benefit for there to be so much extra liquidity, there seems to be a shifting of the demand curve for reserves.  As the banking system has larger reserves, it adapts, regulators adapt, and now we just need more liquidity.  Additionally there doesn't seem to be a good framework of how much reserves we are even supposed to ""optimally"" need.

George Selgin has stated in his working [paper](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/working-paper-50-updated-3.pdf):

>The Fed’s actual interest on reserves policy resembles this last alternative, the difference being its use of subsidized interest on reserve payments instead of high mandatory reserve requirements to boost banks’ demand for reserves. That difference makes the interest on reserves alternative less financially repressive in so far as, instead of exposing banks to a larger required reserve tax burden, it lowers that burden, allowing banks in turn to raise their deposit rates somewhat, instead of having to reduce them as they must when they’re compelled to hold more non-interest-bearing reserves. Interest on reserves therefore has both “income” and “substitution” effects on financial intermediation, where the first increases its overall extent, while the second directs a larger share away from private borrowers and toward the Fed. An increased interest rate on both required and excess reserves will be financially repressive so long as the income effect is small relative to the substitution effect. Since the increase in banks’ net interest income consists mainly if not solely of income earned on their (relatively modest) required reserve balances, and most studies suggest that the demand for bank deposits is not very interest elastic, that’s almost certainly the case.

>One of the most disconcerting features of the post-crisis recovery has been the “great productivity slowdown” that has accompanied it (Kravis 2017). Since the start of the recession in late 2007, labor productivity has grown at an average annual rate of just 1.1
percent—far below the 2.3 percent average growth rate between 1947 and 200. The growth rate of total factor productivity also fell below its pre-crisis trend, where it has remained ever since...San Francisco Fed economists Michael Redmond and Willem Van Zandweghe (2016, p.41) consider a reduced post-crisis supply of credit the “primary suspect” in the post-crisis decline in U.S. total factor productivity, blaming it for having “prevented [established] firms from investing in innovations” and also for making it harder for new firms to enter the market (ibid, p. 39).

The central bank of Norway recognized this problem and got off the ample reserves framework in 2010, [stating](https://static.norges-bank.no/contentassets/cfc83348f4574a719dd5a4ce70a48840/consultative_document_06102010.pdf?v=03/09/2017123145&ft=.pdf):

>When Norges Bank keeps reserves relatively high for a period, it appears that banks gradually adjust to this level…With ever increasing reserves in the banking system, there is a risk that Norges Bank assumes functions that should be left to the market. It is not Norges Bank’s role to provide funding for banks…If a bank has a deficit of reserves towards the end of the day, banks must be able to deal with this by trading in the interbank market.

The ECB seems to be recognizing the dangers as well:

https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230302~41273ad467.en.html

>In the ongoing review of our operational framework, we are analysing whether in the future we will operate under a floor or a corridor system. We hope to conclude this review by the end of the year.

>One important element in our discussion is the amount of central bank reserves required to effectively steer short-term interest rates in either a floor or a corridor system. This amount informs our decision-making as to when balance sheet normalisation might need to be halted. 

>Our current estimates suggest that the amount of central bank reserves currently held by the banking sector exceeds, by a significant margin, the level necessary to steer short-term market rates close to our key policy rate even under a floor system.

>This implies that the current size of our balance sheet is larger than necessary to effectively implement our monetary policy stance. As such, maintaining a large bond portfolio absorbs valuable policy space that may be needed if policy rates were to become constrained again by the effective lower bound.

>Shrinking the balance sheet, to the extent possible, is therefore both prudent and efficient.

>The second reason for reducing the APP portfolio is related to the side effects of running a large balance sheet.

>It is well documented that bond purchases can cause asset price valuations in financial and real estate markets to diverge from their economic fundamentals, thus raising both financial stability risks and wealth inequality.

>Maintaining too large a balance sheet may also have undesirable side effects.

>One is that it could jeopardise central bank’s credibility by giving rise to accusations of financial and fiscal dominance.

>A second side effect is that maintaining a larger balance sheet than necessary increases the Eurosystem’s exposure to credit and duration risk. The probability and extent of net losses are significantly higher the larger the amount of long-term fixed-rate assets the central bank holds on its balance sheet.

So Japan seems like a reasonable data point for ZIRP, QE and their relationship with inflation.  But it doesn't say much about what we're supposed to do after ZIRP.  Moreover QE itself is still a massive experiment.  It's important to consider additionally that Japan is idiosyncratic with a dangerously low birthrate, ageing population, government price controls, as well as a deeply ingrained culture of resisting inflation.;;Now Disney planning layoffs for next month.

1. If I own shares of AAPL in a Roth IRA, regular IRA, and also a normal brokerage account, my question is... does the cost basis for the Roth IRA investment or the regular IRA investment have anything at all to do with the cost basis for the standard account investment? I mean in regards to taxes. For example, let's say my cost basis for AAPL was $170 in my ""standard"" brokerage account. But my cost basis in my Roth is $135, and my cost basis in my regular IRA is $141. The only thing that matters from a tax standpoint is the $170 right?

2. Does the wash sale rule apply to purchases/sales in the Roth and regular IRA accounts? For example, let's say I sell my AAPL in my standard account right now, and it would be a loss. Then, a week later, I make a $7500 contribution to my Roth for 2023 and I buy AAPL for it's current price. Would this cause a problem?


The way I think about Roth and regular IRA transactions, is that they're in their own private ecosphere and they have absolutely nothing to do with anything outside of it. Their own private island.

9,stocks,AliBaba (BABA) valuation,Advice,"Pretty new to investing, I have a small portfolio of \~25k with Ford, DLTR, Google, Meta, VOO, and about 15% of BABA.

I got BABA around 90$ in December, with my thinking that they are consistently having strong earnings, have a large market and room for growth. Although I understand these are somewhat shallow reasons for buying a stock, I expected that my ideas would make sense.

Recently, they posted earnings, which were very strong and beat expectations. Naturally I thought that the stock would at least gain a few points, but despite their strong earnings and little news about the company, it's been tanking day after day.

How does a stock like this get evaluated? Is this just due to the volatility of the Chinese market or am I missing something bad about this company?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11uawl4/alibaba_baba_valuation/,"You'll get a lot of responses about what's wrong with the company, mostly pointing to China risk. I think it's more sentiment with BABA, plus if you look at their margins, the effects of competition are apparent. There are a few Chinese stocks that if you bought in November would be up 75-100%. So it's both company selection, company specific sentiment as well as finding the oversold point. And a stomach for volatility is necessary. 

It's just a hated stock. If you can't hold it for 3-5 years without looking at daily charts, don't hold it.;;I'd avoid Chinese stocks, Economic cold war between US and China will only get worse

Good Luck.;;Baba is very undervalued. 

But has negative sentiment because it's an ADR of a Chinese stock.

First and the most important is the Chinese government who has a significant influence on the country's economy and financial markets. Changes in government policies, regulations, and restrictions can have a significant impact on BABA.

Also there is some concerns that some Chinese companies have been accused of fraudulent accounting practices, such as not reporting all of their revenues or inflating their profits. This can lead to significant losses for investors if the company's true financial position is not accurately reflected in its stock price.

No need to talk about Geopolitical risks and China's relationships with the United States… 

I will stay away from Chinese stocks for now.;;I lost my pants with BABA. Been selling puts and keep getting assigned. 

The world is preparing for WW3 between US and China. I’m kind of dumping money in the naive hope it won’t happen and the knowledge it doesn’t matter where your money is if we decide to go to war. Europe is treating China very differently. But now they have to be friends with Biden because of Russia so they’re following a bit more. But the main difference is that Europe understands you don’t need to be #1 to live a #1 lifestyle. Americans have been on top for so long they fear China to an irrational level. So war is what we’re going to get.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Below is an excerpt explaining the near term issue for some banks and the longer issue for any that take advantage of the asset swaps:

""Insured deposits are the stickiest because they are protected if things go wrong. So Ms Jiang and co-authors looked at uninsured cash. They found that if half of such deposits were to be withdrawn, the remaining assets and equity of 190 American banks would not be enough to cover the rest of their deposits. These banks currently hold $300bn in insured deposits.The newfound ability to swap assets at face value, under the Bank Term Funding Programme, at least makes it easier for banks to pay out depositors. But even this is only a temporary solution. For the Fed’s new facility is something of a confidence trick itself. The programme will prop up struggling banks only so long as depositors think it will. Borrowing through the facility is done at market rates of around 4.5%. This means that if the interest income a bank earns on its assets is below that—and its low-cost deposits leave—the institution will simply die a slow death from quarterly net-interest income losses, rather than a quick one brought about by a bank run."";;The size and speed of these bond moves is a little unnerving.;;Made 1k on Goog in a month so am gonna take the win for now... most of my money is in a fund I never trade so that's kinda new for me;;It’s interesting how the Fed’s $300b bailout of the banks and the Swiss Fed’s $50b bailout of Credit Suisse have had such different effects on the market.

Why are European markets trailing US by 5-6% this week when proportionately, the $300b injected here should have less of a stimulating effect than the $50b there?

When that knife stops falling, I'll be there.;;Reposting this since I didn't get any answers last thread:

Could someone please explain the second paragraph about delta hedging in simple terms:

> Some might wonder why a banking crisis is hitting oil so hard, as it is unlikely to impact crude demand and production. But during periods of elevated volatility, investors tend to pull out of risky assets like oil and invest in safer corners of the market. Oil prices have been very sensitive to the recent shift in risk sentiment, particularly due to the lack of supportive price fundamentals, with US oil inventories building this year.

> What is intensifying the drop in prices is the options market, through so-called delta hedging. Financial institutions sold downside protection instruments (put options) to oil market players, for instance producers. With the oil price falling below the level where the protection kicks in (strike level), those financial institutions now need to avoid having a price risk on their balance sheets. So, they are selling crude futures to offset the risks, amplifying the rout.

So financial institutions sold puts to oil producers, say at a strike price of $80 a barrel. A put option gives the put-buyer the option to sell the underlying asset to the put-writer at the strike price before some expiration date. Say the market price falls to $75 a barrel. This means that the oil producer can sell oil at $80 to the financial firm, forcing the firm to buy oil at $5 more than the real market price. If prices fall even more, the firm takes even bigger losses.

The firm wants to offset this risk. So it sells crude futures. Can someone explain the exact details of how this works? (What would be the price of the sale? Would it be higher or lower than the current market price? Who gets the right to buy/sell?);;Whoever is selling ENPH, please keep it up.

Wow, now that is quite a statistic. This is the 'discount window' tool that has always been offered by the Fed but is sparingly used. [Full article here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-16/banks-rush-to-backstop-liquidity-borrow-164-8-billion-from-fed?srnd=premium). So there is definitely a flood of liquidity being infused by a combination of factors, some already in place (discount window), others by direct intervention (BTFP, big banks banding together).

> Privately-owned housing starts in February 2023 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,450,000. This is 9.8 percent (+/- 15.5%)* above the revised January 2023 estimate of 1,321,000

That is a 90% confidence interval of [-5.7, 25.3], or statistically indistinguishable from 0.

If you look at the other indicators reported by the [Census Bureau Index of Economic Activity](https://www.census.gov/economic-indicators/), housing start estimates have much larger confidence intervals / high uncertainty compared to the other ones.

**Useless comments on my portfolio + BTU Update**:

What a great day for my big tech holdings. AMD up 7.7%, GOOG up 4.7%, MSFT up 4%, SMH up 4%, META up 3.6%. I will soon be using these opportunities to trim (slightly) MSFT/AAPL/AMD as they are too big of an individual position. I'll move the cash into my small cap value ETFs, or from AMD to SMH.

Meanwhile, on the commodity side, yesterday I had went pretty hard on BTU/AMR/XOM/PSCE. Today I added to CF (fertilizer). Some exciting news on BTU is that Investor Relations told some folks that they are working hard to get the surety bond covenants taken care of before March 31st, and at the worst, a little bit into April. A blackout period will start pretty soon (between quarter end and the next earnings report), so they might not get time to start capital returns. But at least an announcement about it will soon occur. Follow @8750Capital and @tradedollarnut on Twitter for more news (you won't find it anywhere else).

I guess we should expect markets to pump in the near-term?

Opponents of the floor system were spot on.  They said abusing QE would create a never ending need for liquidity.  Our only solution is to keep printing.

It's like that saying about porn.  You can't define it but you 100% know it when you see it.  Feels like we are playing with fire and I don't think we'll exactly know when inflation becomes too dangerous and runaway inflation truly becomes more than just a remote possibility.  It will have already arrived and the consequences will be severe.;;GOOG doesn't care that everything else wants to be down huh;;The S&P 500 slid after the European Central Bank kept its hawkish stance while traders tried to read into the Federal Reserve’s next move.

The benchmark index slumped while First Republic Bank plunged, dragging down some of its regional peers, after saying it’s considering options including a sale. The Nasdaq 100 erased an early loss, extending a streak of gains into the fourth day.

The ECB raised its deposit rate to 3% from 2.5% while saying that inflation is projected to remain too high for too long. The central bank declined to provide color on future rate moves, according to a statement.

Signs of unrest persisted in the market as volatility gauges remained elevated and gains in US futures evaporated amid renewed selling of some regional-bank shares.

The Cboe Volatility Index edged up to 26, well above its long-term average of 20.

The banking sector will be backstopped by the fed. A crises of confidence would be unacceptable. It is my opinion that this will blow over in a month or two.

As far as a “landing”. Rate hikes are not necessary bad for stocks. A large factor in stock valuations going higher will be if the fed can thread the needle.  They are hiking into a growing economy where borrowing and lending flow freely. The economy is expanding at a level that even to this day is exceeding the rate hikes.

The fed will keep QT until inflation is down below 2.5%. The risk of letting inflation becoming entrenched is too great for the longer term health of the US economy.

I’m in the 25 and pause camp. I think the surprise that a lot of folks will have to comes to terms with is how long the pause is going to be. As inflation trends lower, I believe the fed funds rate will be kept above core inflation for longer than folks think. 

The value of equities over the next 6-12 months is not a concern to the fed.

As you can see, vast majority are not 30Y but 7.5 yrs or less (75%).  And 56% are 4.5 years or less.  And these all mature eventually so technically all of this is ""temporary"", but that doesn't mean it isn't adding money to the system.

It also appears to me that these loans add to bank reserves at the Fed which are earning extremely generous rates of 4.65% (which btw is causing Fed to operate massively in the red for the first time in history).  Therefore these loans seem to be essentially free.;;I'm going to cash, I can't trade this it's too irrational.

> Some might wonder why a banking crisis is hitting oil so hard, as it is unlikely to impact crude demand and production. But during periods of elevated volatility, investors tend to pull out of risky assets like oil and invest in safer corners of the market. Oil prices have been very sensitive to the recent shift in risk sentiment, particularly due to the lack of supportive price fundamentals, with US oil inventories building this year.

> What is intensifying the drop in prices is the options market, through so-called delta hedging. Financial institutions sold downside protection instruments (put options) to oil market players, for instance producers. With the oil price falling below the level where the protection kicks in (strike level), those financial institutions now need to avoid having a price risk on their balance sheets. So, they are selling crude futures to offset the risks, amplifying the rout.

So financial institutions sold puts to oil producers, say at a strike price of $80 a barrel. A put option gives the put-buyer the option to sell the underlying asset to the put-writer at the strike price before some expiration date. Say the market price falls to $75 a barrel. This means that the oil producer can sell oil at $80 to the financial firm, forcing the firm to buy oil at $5 more than the real market price. If prices fall even more, the firm takes even bigger losses.

The firm wants to offset this risk. So it sells crude futures. Can someone explain the exact details of how this works? (What would be the price of the sale? Would it be higher or lower than the current market price?

And that the models they use are time-tested and proven and stuff.  Ugh, well, they aren't.  This is all experimental and not without disagreement, even within the field itself.

I teach English and one of my students is a PhD economist from a reputable Brazilian university.  He told me yesterday that yes, it would have been a better idea to not act so violently with interest rates both on the downside and upside.

I don't understand why people are defending the Fed or thinking it's stupid to say things against them.  It's actually not established knowledge that what they're doing is the correct course of action in these situations, and that disagreement exists even within the field itself.  The people working at the Fed are only one school of economics and there's no unanimous agreement that the way they've handled things the last 20 years or so is the correct way.

You have to remember that economics not physics or math.  There are no absolute formulas or anything like that.  It's an art as much as a science.  So somehow saying ""the Fed is wrong"" is not necessarily anti-intellectual or anti-science or anything.  I think this is a common misconception.

16,stocks,Keep portfolio / Sell portfolio and put all into Term Deposits. What would you do?,Advice Request,"Hi guys! I'm looking for some advice / points of view on something. For the last couple of weeks i've been thinking and thinking what i should do with my portfolio / investment strategy. So, I'm from Europe, and i currently have some money invested into the US market + some spare money (I'll show the percentages below). Right know, i have some spare money and i have the possibility to it into some Term deposits with maturity from 1 month, up to 3 years, which i think pays out quite good or just keep DCA into the market.

Ok so first, my portfolio right now is still positive overall and it looks like this: VOO - 25%, QQQ - 18%, NVDA - 12%, AAPL - 11%, MSFT - 10%, GOOGL - 7%, RKLB - 3%, UNH - 3% and the rest 11% split into V, ASTS, MA, HD, AMZN, TGT, DIS, BA and TSLA. For the past year or so, i didn't add anything to individual stocks and just DCA into VOO/QQQ every month.

Now, the banks right now have these interests (i've selected from different banks, the best ones for each maturity period): 1 month - 5.7%, 3 months - 7.3%, 6 months - 7.5%, 1 year - 8.2%, 2 years - 8.45%, 3 years - 8.7%. But before you say holy s\*\*t, these are good returns, right now, here, the inflation rate is at 15% (which in reality i think it's even worse), so it's not that great if you look at it that way.

Looking at the market right now, 7.5% or 8.2% seems pretty good. I know the market average return is around 8% to 9% but I'm not sure the market is gonna have these kind of returns (at least the next few years?). But i could be right, i could be wrong of course. I just don't feel like it's gonna do great next period, that's all.

So now back to my dilemma... As i said, for the past year i just DCA each month into VOO/QQQ. Besides what's already invested, i have some spare cash i would like to deploy right now and i see these scenarios.

\- Sell the portfolio, and put it all + spare money + new money each month into term deposits (6 months or 1 year maturity)

\- Keep portfolio as it is and put spare money + new money each month into term deposits

\- Keep portfolio and put the spare money into it + DCA each month as usual and ignore the term deposits

If i missed something, maybe a better option or some information that i missed and might be really important to take into consideration, please tell me. Right now i'm something like 60/40 into second scenario. Just don't touch the portfolio, but put the rest of the money into these deposits (i was thinking the 1 year one may be the best one ?), until the market stabilizes a bit. Also, im in my twenties, so my investment hold period is long. I don't need the money any time soon (that's 1 of the reason why i think the option to keep DCA into the market may be better because of the compound interest?).

I could really use some advice on this guys. What would you do in this situation? Sorry if some terms are not right or something, as im not from US, some things related to investing may be different and i might wrongly translate them. Thanks a lot guys!

TLDR: You have spare money right now. How you choose to use it?

I'm sure we'll see both bulls are bears celebrating at different times and calling the other side idiots;;Well, this is one way to get people to forget about CPI tomorrow.;;Suppose the Fed has been saying for months it will raise rates by 50 basis points in March, and suppose the market believed it. Now say the day before, they say, 'Actually banks are starting to crack a bit, let's pause, and reconsider a hike at the next meeting.'

Obviously, relative to hiking 50 basis points, this is dovish. (In absolute terms, depending on the severity of the financial liquidity crunch, not cutting could still be seen as 'hawkish').

Will inflation suddenly spike? The rates are still at contractionary levels (5%). The lagged effects of all of the previous rates are still there. Is Walmart and Amazon watching the Fed's messaging and deciding to raise prices by 5% instead of 4% because of this? Are consumers around the economy going to demand 6% wage increases instead of 5% wage increases?

If your view is that inflation is literally just a function of what the Federal Funds Rate is and the Fed can move inflation expectations like a joystick, then I could see it. But I don't understand how keeping rates flat in the midst of a financial panic is going to lead to credit markets dramatically easing, consumers going wild and spending even more, businesses taking out more loans... Rates are still pretty high!

Maybe there are lagged effects that will show up in 8 months from this pause instead of hike.

Inflation = function(Fed, financial conditions, international markets, ...). If the financial conditions input is meaningfully tightening on its own, then the Fed input staying flat doesn't necessarily increase inflation.

My personal view: 25 basis points in March, then pause. No cuts in 2023.;;Lord have mercy on us all;;Is Schwab oversold or is there a real risk of insolvency? I'm half tempted to sell puts or just buy shares;;Who knew that bank failures were good for stocks!;;> JPM: +25bps

Prudence is valuable all the time, but this isn't a day to listen to histrionics and revisionism, or panic screams from the ""shortyafters"" here.

If you and everyone else knew JPM was strong and diversified last week, and the week before, and the month before that, and the year before that, then don't let hyperbolic ""sky is falling"" posts erase what you know.

Similarly, if the Fed, looking at the entire field, and looking years into the future, felt that more gradual rate hikes and tightening going forward was called for (and they did, by all their communications) then it would be fairly silly for them to abandon their entire carefully crafted strategy because of (checks notes...) SVB financial.

Thus, even though I'm no fan of rate hikes and have, for 18 months, vocally predicted their limited purpose in taming current inflation, I don't really want to see the fed getting whiplash changing strategies from day to day just based on what peanut gallery hecklers and pundits are yelling at any given moment.

I don't care if they go 50 bps or 25 bps, and you shouldn't either.

Going 25 and then 25 isn't that much different than going 50 and then taking a beat.  Media have blown the whole 25 vs 50 thing out of all sane proportions anyway.  

A 5.75% rate or 5.5% or a 6% rate, they're all basically the same if you zoom out.  

I for one, don't need to see the fed pushing panic buttons more than they already have.

Thanks, fed.;;I singlehandedly held the market up today since I decided to buy a 2x bear ETF.;;I want off this fucking roller coaster;;I just want to say, I've enjoyed /r/stocks the past few days.  Some of the threads about SIVB were worthy of facepalming, what with people making stuff up about ""MORE BAILOUTS"" and the like, and just generally not understanding what's going on.  But I forgive them.  I really mean it when I say those people are victims, too.  If they really think the system is rigged against them and they're constantly getting screwed, well, maybe there's some semblance of truth to that feeling.  I'm not saying what they claim is true or accurate, but maybe they feel like they're always getting screwed because, well, sometimes they genuinely are.

The daily thread has been really cool though.  I don't want to get too sentimental here so I'm not going to tag people, but I've quit enjoyed interacting with all of the regulars as well as with some other pop-ins these last few days.  I've been quite surprised to see that most people have pretty measured and balanced takes in here.  Even when we disagree about certain points, I think most of us understand the gravity of the situation and are willing to have a balanced discussion about it.  I've butted heads with some of y'all in the past, no hard feelings on my end and hope you understand to some degree where I'm coming from.

I have to confess that for me personally this isn't even really about stocks.  This is my place to hang out and talk about macroeconomics, life, and the future of humanity.  Yadda yadda yadda, it ain't always that serious, but it's interesting how the stock market / economy has such a huge effect on our society's wellbeing.  I ain't no economist, but I did major in it, and I guess it's these questions that drew me to it in the first place.

Anyway, I'll leave it here, I do wish everybody good luck.  I guess the good news is that if we're here chatting about stonkz then we're probably somewhat insulated from the potential shocks.  And hey, we live in a world where BAC is a company and not something we have to worry about when getting behind the wheel, so I guess that's a testament to where our priorities are.  Here's to a better life for all of us... at heart, I suppose, I truly am a bull. :);;Looking at Schwab again, if it is really turns out that something’s wrong with Schwab, then whoever dumped that massive position BEFORE all the SVB etc stuff happened needs to be investigated by the SEC. Either some info leaked about something wrong with Schwab, or someone just decided on a whim to dump that huge position. And we all know which is more likely.;;By January next year, the FDIC limit will have existed for almost 9 decades.  And in one fell swoop the Fed has aided a precedent that may lead to it being dismantled altogether.  By making the limit ""infinity"" and all deposits insured, they have a hard time picking winners and losers going forward if another bank fails.  In essence, everyone is now fully insured.

What disturbs me is that we've all accepted this as categorically good and are not even debating it.  The only argument I've heard against it is some random guy starting a bank from scratch, offering 1000% interest and enrinching himself.  This is obviously nonsense.  You still need investors to start a bank, you need to be scrutinized by other lenders, regulators and so on.

To me the problem is much more subtle but real.  It's that there is no incentive for extremely large and sophisticated depositors to diversify.  Why does that matter?  Two reasons in my mind.

* It could create a ""race to the bottom"" like we saw in the S&L crises where CD's or deposit yields become extremely aggressive and no one cares where they concentrate all their money, as long as it has the best return.  It could be destabilizing and having a robust and diverse financial system with many players where the risk is spread around is good.  This could lead to overconcentration of deposits in a few players.
* It encourages executives to engage in risky behavior when the bank is beginning to come under stress for deposits.

The first is pretty straight-forward.  For the second, imagine if a company X has 20% of their $5B in cash at SVB.  In exchange for getting the remaining $4B in deposits, imagine that X either directly or indirectly benefits.  A key client in their network or the company itself not only gets attractive yields on deposits but an overly favorable loan.  We know from history that even the smartest executives will gamble and do silly things to keep a bad charade going, hoping for a miracle turnaround.  The best part is that the exec could tell clients to move deposits to them at 0 risk.  The FDIC will take the hit which in turn will tax the entire industry.

I think it's definitely worth thinking about but as always we're too busy trying to swallow down the shitburger in front of us.  One thing is clear though, either the limit should be increased to much higher and perhaps with conditions that only apply to very sophisticated companies, capable of good risk management, or the limit shouldn't even exist.;;Just made 50K on Wal….;;Rate cuts because of shit hitting the fan is not bullish;;Sorry people are losing money but this is the most fun I've had with stocks since the GME short squeeze.

Granted it's not the majority of people but it does seem to be a sizable minority. I think the current events are a good time to point out that while ""diversification is protection against ignorance"" you ARE ignorant. Even if you've read every financial document, listened to every earnings call, and did hours of DD there are things you are just never going to know or be able to predict.

These statements about diversification are meant to caution experts in their field against excessive diversification out of fear, but often people in this sub take it to mean ""if you believe in a company, put all your cash into it. As long as you did sufficient DD and believe hard enough you'll get a huge return on your investment"" you can do all your DD right and still get it wrong because of things you couldn't have known from DD.;;I don't really understand the market reaction here.

*""A final drawback of the use of aggressively easy monetary policies in the aftermath of a boom is the eventual need to devise an “exit” policy... This implies a delicate balancing act for the monetary authorities, in which tightening must be slow enough to avoid destabilising financial markets, but fast enough not to destabilise inflationary expectations.""*

That recent events have come as a surprise to anyone is a failure of mainstream economic thinking and also public knowledge.

>* We have access to significant liquidity, including an estimated $100 billion of cash flow from cash on hand, portfolio-related cash flows, and net new assets we anticipate realizing over the next twelve months. We believe we have upwards of $8 billion in potential retail CD issuances per month, plus over $300 billion of incremental capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and other short-term facilities – including the recently announced Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP).


>* Our approach to managing our assets is quite different than traditional banks. So before closing, I wanted to provide some thoughts on recent comments by some pundits regarding unrealized losses within bank held-to-maturity (HTM) portfolios. As a reminder, our banks’ loan-to-deposit ratio is approximately 10% and nearly all the loans are over-collateralized by first-lien mortgages or securities. The remainder of our assets are invested in high-quality, liquid securities in either our available-for-sale (AFS) portfolio, working capital at the parent or broker-dealer subsidiaries, or in our HTM portfolio. Focusing attention on unrealized losses within HTM has two logical flaws. First, those securities will mature at par, and given our significant access to other sources of liquidity there is very little chance that we’d need to sell them prior to maturity (as the name implies). Second, by looking at unrealized losses among HTM securities, but not doing the same for traditional banks’ loan portfolios, the analysis penalizes firms like Schwab that in fact have a higher quality, more liquid, and more transparent balance sheet.;;Now this is interesting.

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/investtalk/id280789489;;People keep saying ""Fed is pausing or cutting into disaster is not bullish"".  What people fail to realize is that FRC and regional banks is not the economy.

Retail has excess inventory and BBBY goes under that doesn't necessarily tank the economy.

THE REAL metric is whether financial conditions remain sufficiently loose, credit is flowing, and the megabanks continue to be extremely strong.  Which they are.

In this case, Fed supporting the economy by eliminating the FDIC limit is yes very bullish.  Fed allowing more printing with BTFP to protect jobs is bullish.;;[deleted]"
18,dividends,Free Resources for Research,Due Diligence,"Hey Gang,

I saw a post not too long ago talking about articles and information behind paywalls, so it gave me the idea to post a list of all the free resources I use when researching and what I use them for. These are in no particular order, I am just copy/pasting them from my own bookmarked folder, so sorry if it feels like I'm jumping around a bit. Enjoy!

&#x200B;

* [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) \- Basic stock/ETF information, financials going a few years back, historic performance, dividend and split history available on the chart.
* [Macrotrends](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/research) \- More in depth financials with many stocks going 10+ years back, can break it down either annually or quarterly. Also hovering over each line item will produce a chart so its easier to comprehend the data. Can also look at historical interest rates, inflation, certain commodities, mortgage rates, etc.
* [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/) \- Can be informative to read opinion articles of what others are saying about a stock/fund, especially around earnings time. Obviously use caution because there are a lot of idiots that are allowed to write on this website. Seeking Alpha also usually publishes earnings calls transcripts for most stocks. Emphasis on usually and most lol. I only have a free account but once I run out of free articles I am usually able to put the link to an article through a paywall remover (**SEE 12ft Ladder BELOW**). I find it beneficial to have the app with at least the stocks I own set as a watchlist so I get price/earnings alerts. For someone who doesn't pay the most attention to the markets on a daily basis it is really helpful.
* [Slickcharts](https://www.slickcharts.com/) \- Metrics on certain indices. I don't use this one often but sometimes I like to see where the weights are of different companies in the S&P 500. If you're looking for a certain company on the list you can CTRL + F to search for that stock. Also if you're doing any sort of experiment/backtest and need a random stock you can google a random number generator 1-500 and go to that number in the S&P 500.
* [Finviz](https://finviz.com/map.ashx) \- Index maps, bubble charts, screeners. Can break it down by sector, industry, certain dividend yield, certain payout ratio, etc. All free. You could upgrade to premium but I don't really see a point tbh. Also if you screen you can sort by custom metrics.
* [dqydj.com](https://dqydj.com/calculators/) \- Almost any backtesting calculator you could ever want. You can put in starting amount and even recurring contributions if you so choose. I see a lot of people recommending portfoliovisualizer for backtesting. I honestly haven't tried it because I don't do a lot of backtesting (yknow that old saying, something about past performance and future results), but if portfoliovisualizer works better for the crowd then by all means ignore this one.
* [Multpl](https://www.multpl.com/sitemap) \- A lot more index metrics. I use this one more than Slickcharts when looking at historical market metrics. Pick your poison I guess.
* [Open Insider](http://openinsider.com/) \- I think a lot of people know about this one. Basically just compiles every Form 4 for every public company. All insider buys/sells as they are reported. I had used a couple different websites prior to hearing about Open Insider, but I exclusively use this one now. It's the best that I've seen for insider trading information.
* [Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/) \- I basically only use them for the occasional earnings call transcript that I can't find elsewhere. I personally think their opinion articles usually suck and don't get me started about ""THIS STOCK COULD 10X IN THE NEXT 3 DAYS BUY NOW BEFORE ITS TOO LATE"" lol.
* [CAGR Calculator](https://cagrcalculator.net/result/) \- I use this for looking at average historical growth. Could be anything, earnings, dividends, stock price, etc. Just kinda one of those I like to keep open when researching so I don't have to break out the TI84+ lol.
* [Dividend Growth Calculator](https://dividendathlete.com/dividend-growth-calculator/) \- Got this one from Dividend Athlete on Instagram. Not terrible content (kinda generic at times but what are you gonna do) so give him a follow if you so choose. Regardless, you can put in expected dividend growth, starting yield, and starting amount etc. The output is final portfolio value and dividends received every year, both with and without reinvestment. Kinda neat to see.
* [ETF.com](https://www.etf.com/) \- Compiles a bunch information on a bunch of ETFs all in one place. Could be easier to compare between different funds as well.
* [ETF Database](https://etfdb.com/etfs/) \- ditto
* [GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/new_index/) \- Some more basic stock information. I use this one most for looking at ROIC if the company does not mention it in their own releases. I have a free account that only gives you so many tickers per day or however they measure it, but going into an incognito window usually gets rid of the problem fairly easily.
* [Dividend Value Builder](https://dividendvaluebuilder.com/dividend-kings-list/) \- A while ago I was doing a lot of research/backtesting on the Dividend Kings. I found this list to be mostly complete and among the most accurate. There are still errors (VFC is still on there, Rest In Peace soldier), but fairly accurate nonetheless. I've also talked to the guy that runs the page before via email. Cool guy, got back to me fairly quickly.
* [Dividend Growth Investor](https://www.dividendgrowthinvestor.com/p/dividend-kings.html) \- Basically ditto to previous. Some more historical information as well. I believe this page also has a lot of blog posts so feel free to read those at your discretion.
* [David Fish Dividends List](http://www.tessellation.com/david_fish/) \- For those that really want to go above and beyond, these are the mostly lists of Dividend Kings and more, published by the guy who came up with the term Dividend King in 2007. He died in 2018. This man inspired a generation without knowing it, and yet barely anybody knows him. Next on my to-do list is to find his grave so I can pay my respects /s.
* [SEC EDGAR](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html) \- For those that don't know, every public company must publish basically all official documents to the SEC and they legally have to be publicly available to all investors. Here where those bad boys end up. Punch in a ticker and let your heart run wild.
* [alreits](https://alreits.com/) \- Basic information on a bunch of REITs all in one place. Can be good for sorting/comparison.
* [List of Preferred Stocks](https://stockmarketmba.com/listofpreferredstocks.php) \- ditto, but with preferreds instead of REITs.
* [Briclayer](https://briclayer.com/publications/) \- More REIT information/publications. I bookmarked them a long time ago but looks like they haven't published much since October. Could still be interesting to read some of the articles. Looks like they also have a basic list of REITs.
* [Bond Lookup](https://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/bonds/search?ORDER_BY=TURNOVER&ORDER_DIRECTION=DESC) \- Took this idea straight from Peter Lynch. Sometimes I look at bond prices to judge the credit risk of a company (We got CVNA bonds selling as low as 28 cents on the dollar lol). Maybe it's just me but I couldn't find any normal website like Yahoo Finance to look at prices so I present to you all, Borse Frankfurt. Sometimes it can take a while to load and I think it's technically in euros lol but the concept is still the same. Type in your company of choice, click it, hit Start Search.
* [12ft Ladder](https://12ft.io/) \- Removes **MOST** paywalls. If you have a website where there's a paywall to read an article you saw, copy the entire URL and paste it into this website. This website is why I don't pay for stock research.
* [Compound Interest Calculator](http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm) \- I'm sure you all have your compound interest calculator of choice. This is mine. Nothing special, just figured I'd throw it in.
* [Moody's](https://www.moodys.com/) \- A friend tipped me off to this one. If you are a student or know a student, most school emails work to get you basic access to Moody's. I mostly look at present and historical credit ratings. I think you may be able to get some recent rationales on the ratings with the limited student account, but don't quote me on that. I also haven't tried putting Moody's through 12ft Ladder, so feel free to try that if you're feeling adventurous.
* [Conference Call Transcripts](http://www.conferencecalltranscripts.org/) \- This website also seems to have a lot of free earnings call transcripts, and it seems like its kept pretty up to date contrary to some other websites that may only have calls from a year+ ago (looking at you Motley Fool).

That's what I got! Like I said, I've never paid for stock research and quite frankly I don't believe in it. The big analysts with their fancy Bloomberg terminals have no advantage over the little guy as long as you know where to look. Remember, Google is your friend.

Happy Investing!

\- Bfish",https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/11uyoec/free_resources_for_research/,"I'm going to add 2 that I personally use.

1) Koyfin - It is *not* a Bloomberg Terminal, but if you're a commoner like me and want a general idea of what it is, Koyfin is a ""light"" version that punches well above it's weight class. Incredibly in depth financials tracking upwards of 300 different metrics, customizable watchlists, stock screeners, economic calendars, news feeds, earnings transcripts, you name it. They have a free version with well more than enough data to be worthwhile. Once you learn the UI and the quick codes, you can jump around the site super fast. Much easier to read than, say, Yahoo Finance. I personally find it valuable enough to pay for some advanced features, but it's not at all necessary for most use cases.

2) Quartr - free to use earnings call compiler. You can listen to the actual call live (or later), read the transcript, search for keywords, etc. They're fairly new, and continue rolling out new features, like recently expanding into other company presentations.

These two now comprise 98% of all the investment research gathering I use.;;Excellent list.;;Great information!!"

Yes you can use cloudflare with the app to off load demand from cloud servers but really that's only a problem for a few people.

They have expanded into other features like verification, VPN and access as well as trying to offer local execution(to save cost on Amazon).

I think they were a good company with a core set of features 5 years ago. Now you log in and you are over-loaded with features you don't need."

23,ValueInvesting,How Much is a Stock Worth Long-Term (Opinion),Discussion,"I recently got input from value investors that they are looking for investments to hold long term - Buffet style (10Y+) as a going concern, implying that a DCF isn’t applicable. The argument is that investors should hold these companies (essentially forever) and benefit from the compounding effects in the future.

After a bit of tinkering, I decided to take my furthest forward cash flows and derive an enterprise value from them. Damodaran calls this “*Really, really forward value*” in an attempt to illustrate the absurdity of straying away from the present value.

What I got is what would be the value if we jumped 10-Y in the future AND the success story of a company panned out.

This implies levels of risk that I can’t begin to quantify, but there does seem to be a use case for this estimate: we can use it to see what can be priced-in a company from an investor that has **maximum fear of missing out (FOMO).**

## Mechanics

I take the forecasted FCFF in 10 years and discount it with a cost of capital at maturity. I then adjust debt to capital to reflect the industry average and get the future **Enterprise Value**.

## Model

You can find it as a “Long Term (10Y) Price Target” in the valuation report, or in the “Output” tab under the hidden sheets.

# [MODEL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SuGdj0Xq_72ZrH9fI2Eu04roa7fpNIHpT2aw4Ado4N8/copy)

In the example of GOOGL, I got a present value of $83.3 per share and a peak (or FOMO) value of $147.4 per share. Implying that **depending on how investors perceive the company**, it may be around fairly valued or have 60% upside.

Note that we are using the same fundamental estimates, just changing point in time when an investor “values a company”.

## My Take

Companies approaching maturity may provide returns to investors in the form of dividends or price per-share increases with buybacks, but they rarely have opportunities to increase in value.

Even the long-term value can be quantified (with a massive dose of uncertainty) but expecting both returns and value appreciation in maturity may be inconsistent.

My opinion is that we can indeed quantify how much a company is worth long-term, but even that has limits after which investors should contemplate taking profits.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/11qdc40/how_much_is_a_stock_worth_longterm_opinion/,"""Companies approaching maturity may provide returns to investors in the form of dividends or price per-share increases with buybacks, but they rarely have opportunities to increase in value.

Even the long-term value can be quantified (with a massive dose of uncertainty) but expecting both returns and value appreciation in maturity may be inconsistent.""

Dividends and share repurchases are both functions of capital return, not value creation.

It really comes down to where a company is in the lifecycle. As companies mature, they (generally) have fewer and fewer reinvestment opportunities, or fewer opportunities to earn favorable ROIIC. Prudent to incrementally return capital to shareholders while still engaging in favorable reinvestment. While 'maturity' is often illustrated in a DCF as a terminal growth rate in-line with GDP growth, maturation can take much longer than the 10-year growth forecast period."
