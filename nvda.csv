1,wallstreetbets,🚀🌕 NVDA: Crypto Slump Ain't Holding Us Back – Gaming Revenues Ready to Blast Off! 💥🎮,DD,"Greetings, fellow degenerates! Buckle up, because it's time to talk about a stock that's primed for some explosive gains. 

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), the unstoppable GPU powerhouse that's about to see gaming revenues skyrocket, despite the hurting crypto industry.

Crypto Who? 🤔
While it's true that NVIDIA has dipped its toes into the crypto waters with their Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP) product line, don't let the current crypto slump fool you. In Q1 2021, CMP sales accounted for only $155 million, about 2.74% of NVIDIA's total revenue of $5.66 billion. That's peanuts compared to their gaming segment, which brought in a whopping $2.76 billion or 49% of the total revenue. So even if the crypto industry takes a hit, NVDA's bottom line remains resilient, and they're ready to dominate the gaming market.

Gaming Revenues: Ready for Lift-off 🚀
In the past five years, NVIDIA has seen a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 20%, and with a new generation of gaming consoles and blockbuster games hitting the shelves, the demand for high-performance GPUs is about to skyrocket. NVIDIA's GeForce GPUs are gamers' top choice, and we all know that the gaming market is booming. Global gaming industry revenue is projected to reach $196 billion by 2022, up from $159.3 billion in 2020. As more people turn to gaming for entertainment, NVIDIA is poised to reap the rewards, translating into juicy gains for us degenerate apes.

Cloud Gaming: The Next Frontier 🌌
Cloud gaming is gaining traction, and NVIDIA is already ahead of the game with its GeForce NOW platform. The cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48.2% from 2021 to 2028, reaching $7.24 billion by 2028. As more gamers shift to cloud gaming, NVIDIA's gaming revenues will further soar, making the crypto industry's struggles look like a minor speed bump on the road to the moon.

So, fellow degenerates, strap in and prepare for takeoff, because NVDA is ready to show the world that the gaming industry's gains will overshadow any crypto woes. Remember, this ain't financial advice, and always do your own research. But don't be surprised if we're all partying on the moon with our sweet, sweet NVDA tendies. 🌕🍗",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11vlkut/nvda_crypto_slump_aint_holding_us_back_gaming/,"NVIDIA is being pumped by the present AI craze because GPUs are the best drivers of deep learning.

And this dude is talking about the video game market. Lol;;You boast about its 5.66 billion total revenue

The market cap is currently 641 billion

Lmao;;They added more in market cap last week then what these two new segments are expected to grow by.;;Glad to see NVDA bull posts, feeling better about puts now;;Just be mindful that Cramer was propping NVDA up last week. Inverse Cramer may strike!;;Crypto miners being only 2.7% of  their revenue is a flat out lie. Miners were buying gaming gpus to mine, no way to figure out the real percentage. My guess is it was closer to 30%;;I see a bunch of emojis without reading the post, so I’m buying NVDA, whatever that is;;Gaming is a known market. I don’t think there will be any big surprises. Covid juiced up game revenue for a year or two but it is reverted back to the mean now. 

What I am excited about and not on many people’s radar is their datacenter virtual GPU offerings. Rich content and digital assets are being created at an unprecedented rate. Older computers are being replaced with light-spec laptops and workloads are shifted to data centers with virtual GPUs. This is currently not a huge market yet, but it could develop into a major profit center if the trend continues. I used to demand a physical beefy machine under my desk, but now I only want a 16-inch laptop and 2 32-inch monitors and a good-spec VM that fits my need.;;Which new gen consoles are using Nvidia?;;Meanwhile in reality. 

AMD make the console SOCs. 

Nvidia are getting flamed for their greed. Mid range 4070 looks set to be 750 bucks. For the upper mid range. 4080s are sitting on shelves. 

Forward PE is already 44. Nvidia is already overvalued.;;>I completely agree with SlenderMan69. NVIDIA is poised for big things in the gaming industry, and their GeForce NOW platform is leading the way in cloud gaming. With global gaming revenue projected to reach $196 billion by 2022, there is huge potential for NVDA to continue growing at a rapid pace. So buckle up and hold on tight, because NVDA is about to take us all on a wild ride to the moon!;;Even crypto about to take off again at these prices🚀🚀."

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 62% and 77%.

12,wallstreetbets,"GICS restructuring Friday, March 17",News,"GICS stock/index restructuring coming this Friday after market close. Meaning fund managers will be reallocating their portfolios.

https://www.etfstrategy.com/gics-changes-set-to-impact-sp-500-and-sector-etfs-10339/

This Friday is also monthly options expiry and quad witching.

Tuesday: CPI
Wednesday: Retail sales
Thursday: jobless claims & ECB rate decision 

The GICS restructuring news has been out for some time but no one is talking about it. Just one more thing that look into amidst the current circus. 

Main takeaways are financials restructuring to be more “valuable” and tech becoming more underweight in indexing but take a deeper look into the the restructuring and reallocations for your own sake. 

Lastly, I’m curious to see an update from 22 year old trust fund net worth in short dated NVDA puts.

When you have people underwater on their overpriced car it’s going to be hard to flip them into a new deal, some are taking themselves out the market due to the poor pricing and rising interest rates will decrease demand.

17,stocks,Keep portfolio / Sell portfolio and put all into Term Deposits. What would you do?,Advice Request,"Hi guys! I'm looking for some advice / points of view on something. For the last couple of weeks i've been thinking and thinking what i should do with my portfolio / investment strategy. So, I'm from Europe, and i currently have some money invested into the US market + some spare money (I'll show the percentages below). Right know, i have some spare money and i have the possibility to it into some Term deposits with maturity from 1 month, up to 3 years, which i think pays out quite good or just keep DCA into the market.

Ok so first, my portfolio right now is still positive overall and it looks like this: VOO - 25%, QQQ - 18%, NVDA - 12%, AAPL - 11%, MSFT - 10%, GOOGL - 7%, RKLB - 3%, UNH - 3% and the rest 11% split into V, ASTS, MA, HD, AMZN, TGT, DIS, BA and TSLA. For the past year or so, i didn't add anything to individual stocks and just DCA into VOO/QQQ every month.

Now, the banks right now have these interests (i've selected from different banks, the best ones for each maturity period): 1 month - 5.7%, 3 months - 7.3%, 6 months - 7.5%, 1 year - 8.2%, 2 years - 8.45%, 3 years - 8.7%. But before you say holy s\*\*t, these are good returns, right now, here, the inflation rate is at 15% (which in reality i think it's even worse), so it's not that great if you look at it that way.

Looking at the market right now, 7.5% or 8.2% seems pretty good. I know the market average return is around 8% to 9% but I'm not sure the market is gonna have these kind of returns (at least the next few years?). But i could be right, i could be wrong of course. I just don't feel like it's gonna do great next period, that's all.

So now back to my dilemma... As i said, for the past year i just DCA each month into VOO/QQQ. Besides what's already invested, i have some spare cash i would like to deploy right now and i see these scenarios.

\- Sell the portfolio, and put it all + spare money + new money each month into term deposits (6 months or 1 year maturity)

\- Keep portfolio as it is and put spare money + new money each month into term deposits

\- Keep portfolio and put the spare money into it + DCA each month as usual and ignore the term deposits

If i missed something, maybe a better option or some information that i missed and might be really important to take into consideration, please tell me. Right now i'm something like 60/40 into second scenario. Just don't touch the portfolio, but put the rest of the money into these deposits (i was thinking the 1 year one may be the best one ?), until the market stabilizes a bit. Also, im in my twenties, so my investment hold period is long. I don't need the money any time soon (that's 1 of the reason why i think the option to keep DCA into the market may be better because of the compound interest?).

I could really use some advice on this guys. What would you do in this situation? Sorry if some terms are not right or something, as im not from US, some things related to investing may be different and i might wrongly translate them. Thanks a lot guys!

TLDR: You have spare money right now. How you choose to use it?
