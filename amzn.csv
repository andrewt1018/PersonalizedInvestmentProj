# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 62% and 77%.

GOOGL 2.28%

META 1.92%

MSFT 1.78%

AMZN 1.39%

The auto industry is currently in a recession, and TSLA will be affected, so it has been a little weak recently.

Chip design duo AMD and NVDA have not been dragged down by semiconductors and bucked the trend today. INTC came back from failure, rising 9.35% in the first five trading days.

One strategy is to only buy stocks that have risen sharply rather than stocks that have fallen sharply, because from the lessons of last year, we can understand that thunderstorms have no bottom. Even META TSLA has experienced a collapse of more than 70% from its high point. On the contrary, if the big rising stocks are still 30% to 40% off from the historical high, and the p/e is very low, they are still very cheap.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11t3eke/safe_haven_the_stock_market_is_redeyed_at_present/,"Buy SPY and chill.;;I personally hate META.

6,stocks,Should I wait for Amazon to go back up to the price I bought it at before selling or sell it now at a loss for the tax break?,,"I have a couple of stocks in a moo moo account that I wanted to transfer to Fidelity but I just found out that it costs $75 for each stock to transfer. There's no way I'm going to pay that so my other option to move the stocks that I have in moo moo is to just sell them and rebuy them back in Fidelity. 

The only stock I actually bought with moo moo was Amzn(the others were shares just given to me)when it was $111. I bought $1,000 worth. It's obviously down right now so I was curious if it's better for me to sell it now at a loss and get the tax break for next year or just wait for it to go back to what I bought it for and then sell it and rebuy it in Fidelity. 

I want to have all of my investments with Fidelity so that's why I'm looking to close out my moo moo account. Any help would be appreciated. I just started investing last year so still learning. I apologize if this is the wrong forum to ask this and please direct me to the correct one if so.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11reefm/should_i_wait_for_amazon_to_go_back_up_to_the/,"I’d sell, take the tax break.

7,stocks,Keep portfolio / Sell portfolio and put all into Term Deposits. What would you do?,Advice Request,"Hi guys! I'm looking for some advice / points of view on something. For the last couple of weeks i've been thinking and thinking what i should do with my portfolio / investment strategy. So, I'm from Europe, and i currently have some money invested into the US market + some spare money (I'll show the percentages below). Right know, i have some spare money and i have the possibility to it into some Term deposits with maturity from 1 month, up to 3 years, which i think pays out quite good or just keep DCA into the market.

Ok so first, my portfolio right now is still positive overall and it looks like this: VOO - 25%, QQQ - 18%, NVDA - 12%, AAPL - 11%, MSFT - 10%, GOOGL - 7%, RKLB - 3%, UNH - 3% and the rest 11% split into V, ASTS, MA, HD, AMZN, TGT, DIS, BA and TSLA. For the past year or so, i didn't add anything to individual stocks and just DCA into VOO/QQQ every month.

Now, the banks right now have these interests (i've selected from different banks, the best ones for each maturity period): 1 month - 5.7%, 3 months - 7.3%, 6 months - 7.5%, 1 year - 8.2%, 2 years - 8.45%, 3 years - 8.7%. But before you say holy s\*\*t, these are good returns, right now, here, the inflation rate is at 15% (which in reality i think it's even worse), so it's not that great if you look at it that way.

Looking at the market right now, 7.5% or 8.2% seems pretty good. I know the market average return is around 8% to 9% but I'm not sure the market is gonna have these kind of returns (at least the next few years?). But i could be right, i could be wrong of course. I just don't feel like it's gonna do great next period, that's all.

So now back to my dilemma... As i said, for the past year i just DCA each month into VOO/QQQ. Besides what's already invested, i have some spare cash i would like to deploy right now and i see these scenarios.

\- Sell the portfolio, and put it all + spare money + new money each month into term deposits (6 months or 1 year maturity)

\- Keep portfolio as it is and put spare money + new money each month into term deposits

\- Keep portfolio and put the spare money into it + DCA each month as usual and ignore the term deposits

If i missed something, maybe a better option or some information that i missed and might be really important to take into consideration, please tell me. Right now i'm something like 60/40 into second scenario. Just don't touch the portfolio, but put the rest of the money into these deposits (i was thinking the 1 year one may be the best one ?), until the market stabilizes a bit. Also, im in my twenties, so my investment hold period is long. I don't need the money any time soon (that's 1 of the reason why i think the option to keep DCA into the market may be better because of the compound interest?).

I could really use some advice on this guys. What would you do in this situation? Sorry if some terms are not right or something, as im not from US, some things related to investing may be different and i might wrongly translate them. Thanks a lot guys!

TLDR: You have spare money right now. How you choose to use it? Sell portfolio and put everything into Term deposits (at least for the next couple of years) / Keep portfolio and put rest into Term deposits / Ignore the Term deposits and keep DCA into the market as usual.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11qdthr/keep_portfolio_sell_portfolio_and_put_all_into/,"8.2% is quite good I will put everything there.;;Those interest rates seem super high, do you have any examples of the banks you have selected?"

Any experienced investor can suggest whether it Would be wiser to sell and take the loss and invest elsewhere or hold for the long run.,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11pbyh8/amzn_sell_or_hold/,"For only five shares, I'd just hold it.;;If you’re trippin over 5 shares of stock, I would just stick to index funds;;When Amazon, Disney, Google, Meta were in the top they were shilled hard, now when it's time to buy ""should I sell? help plz"".

Ideally average down
Amazon will have a run at some point;;Hold. Jeff Bezos told me that it's going to moon next week.;;Hold. It’s undervalued;;This depends on your time horizon. Stocks are investments for 3 to 5 years or longer. Over that time frame holding may be prudent. If on the other hand you are just looking to buy the dip and trade short term, then your trade failed and time to sell, and re-evaluate your trading methodology.;;I have a bag for you.;;Buy 95 more, sell OTM CC’s forever, bro down.;;I for one own 100 shares and just wrote 2 contracts for 85p on April 6. What does this mean? I took advantage or am hoping to take advantage of the pessimism and negative price movement on Amazon. I sold these contracts for $130 credit each, thus I received $260 to leverage 17,000 to Amazon until April 6. This is ~1.5% return on investment should Amazon not be under $85 on April 6.

If Amazon goes under $85 then on April 6 I will be buying 200 shares for $85. However, if I subtract the $260 credit I got, it’s like I’m getting the shares for $83.70. Why am I doing this risk, I’m already comfortable holding shares here in the low 90s but I’ll gladly take more if it falls to 85. I’ll just decide to take some credit now instead of holding onto my money because I still think it won’t get that low.

All of this to tell you just hold those 5 shares you have. Sure, it could drop another 7-10 and you may lose another $35-50 but Amazon is a longer term play. I’d look at it as a solid play in an account which may average around 5-10% per year gain but you could make some extra if you’re savvy writing options if you have enough $;;I was early on AMZN stock.  As in back before anyone had it or thought it would be viable.  Also had business relationship that meant direct contact with Bezos staff.  Lots of product to and from.  Told many people of it.  

Well, I saw standards slipping a decade ago and gradually scaled completely away probably 5-6 years ago.  In recent years, customers are noticing the cracks and problems.  It's now an ad-laden, unusable flea market for counterfeit and offshore suppliers.  Delivery and customer service standards have imploded.  

It's been forever since I heard a consumer-based positive, and it seems there's just one negative story after another.  I think pandemic spared and slowed their decline, but they're back on that same trajectory

People used to check out products locally and then order from Amazon.  That has almost flipped.  Businesses used to fear Amazon announcing a move into their space.  Now, they almost welcome it, because they'll be able to show how they're doing it better than bad big Amazon.  

All of that said, the counter case is that most of the big bombed out stocks that have had huge rallies in the last year have had similar horrible narratives and sick prognoses.  So maybe AMZN will copy what's happened with NVDA, TSLA, META, CRM, NFLX.  All of those were considered walking dead, and frankly none of them has actually made any kind of significant change or announcement to deserve their 60 to 100+% rebounds.  

These names and others just had to string two or even one tempting tale and the bulls took it from there.  

Netflix ""customers hate us but now we're going to sell ads and don't look too closely at our plans because we have none and oops we had to refund the advertisers and next our plan to to bug our customers and call them thieves""

Tesla - our pathological owner maybe be getting more pascistic by the day, but he now says he's going to stop dumping stock (maybe) and we're slashing prices because we're the only car company somehow building up inventory right now.""

Nvidia - we can't gouge on the price of our videogame chips by calling them crypppt products anymore, so now we'll call them AI chips.

Meta - we'll stop talking about our silly avatar world vision so much, and we'll fire a bunch of the people who had nothing to do with it.  

And so on.  

So all AMZN really needs to do is say one or two things the market wants to hear.  They don't even have to be necessarily great or even true.  Announce big layoffs or say they're cutting back on lord of the rings spending, maybe announce a new CEO that's not like an NPC.  Say they're turning delivery logistics over to AI.  Or possibly the biggest thing, say they're segmenting the Chinese/counterfeit goods off to a separate website and ""consulting"" with Bezos to bring the web store back to something more trustworthy and customer friendly.  The stock wouldn't even wait for them to actually do these things.  Just the whiff of them maybe happening would spark it up.  Even just someone there admitting they've lost their their way and that the pizza tastes like cardboard, that alone could revive the stock.;;Hold and buy more;;Bruh...;;Not financial advice but I don't understand why you would sell this position, especially when the whole market is down. Don't buy anything you wouldn't want to own forever and just hold it unless it really doesn't make sense anymore. Amazon is a massive company with growth prospects. I doubt you lose money on that position if you just wait. I have a couple positions that I'm down like 80% on right now and I'm still just holding them because I think it can come back eventually. Individual stocks are volatile. If it bothers you to look at that, maybe go index funds and just hold them until retirement.;;Sold 2 puts 85 and 80 strike.

Can't argue with that thorough analysis.;;Do you need the money right now, at this moment? No? Then hold. Are you shitting bricks you can't make rent, credit card payment, or a loan shark? Yes?

General trend is up. Give it 10 years and it will double or triple in value. I really can't think of any companies that can replace Amazon.  This is the fundamentals of playing stocks, you invest in the company you believe in long term not just buy and sell every few months or years. You put your extra money in stocks and forget it. Never look at it or it will stress you out;;I'm holding;;Yeah, buy high sell low is the best strategy long term"
