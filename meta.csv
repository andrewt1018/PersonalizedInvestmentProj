0,wallstreetbets,Meandering rant on banks and VR,Discussion,"As time approaches infinity every bank will eventually fold due to common negligence creeping in or a black swan event but the ones with a good strategy are of course much more likely to survive.

The system can absorb one stupid bank folding if it made particularly UNIQUELY bad choices, but if the problem is uncovered to be systematic and pervasive across the banking system like in 2008 trust will collapse fast and shit is really gonna hit the fan.

I'm ambivalent about the bailout. Oops did I say bailout I meant bailout of course. Even less accountability now. Bankers need to be held accountable somehow or we need to regulate the fuck out of the banking system, otherwise they will just always want to hit the gas pedal to line their pockets with bonuses and if the drunken drive speedrace hits a wall well I guess fuck the rest of us coz they always got an ejection seat.

Also I'm not against the bailout, it was probably the right call I just hate that it had to be done. But some people need to be blindfolded and put against the wall for this. Figuratively of course. Not fines, I'm taking fucking prison. Not long, just enough to to be humiliated and long enough to meditate on the stupidity of putting all your eggs in one basket labeled ""tech start-ups hanging on the teat of benevolent investors"".

Also Zuckerfuck tanking the metaverse... Infinite fucking money to build a better version of a free program called VR chat and they somehow manage to strangle themselves in their onesie. Man VR is by far the coolest shit on this planet right now and investors are down and exhausted regarding VR because of meta and it really played a significant role in investors getting antsy with tech startups and not wanting to part with their money because ""if even big boy galaxy brain Zuckerberg can't make it work"" then who could? I guess the two neckbeards who did VR chat could have pulled it off for give or take 30 million.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11uawh1/meandering_rant_on_banks_and_vr/,">I don't really have much to say about the bailout other than it was probably necessary. I do think that bankers need to be held accountable for their actions, but I'm not sure how that would work in practice. As for Zuckerfuck tanking the metaverse, I agree that it was a huge mistake and VR could have been so much cooler if he had just invested a little bit more money into it.;;First, if we jailed everyone for a move that looked good at the time, but went south due to circumstances beyond their control,  everyone on earth would be in prison.  It was a dumb move, not sinister or illegal.   Orchestrating a run on these banks is what caused the failure.  A realistic way of looking at it is you just bought a house with a mortgage and had 5k in credit card debt.  Under the current terms, you can pay everything off over time, just fine.  But then, someone decides to call your mortgage and credit card debt.  You can't pay, because you run on leverage. So you are now bankrupt. You didn't have to be.  You would have continued to pay on time as agreed.  But the small print said it was callable and you couldn't meet the call at that moment.  Given time, you could have arranged other financing, but they didn't give you time.  You are bankrupt, ruined.  Should they put you in jail?  This is the banking situation. It runs on leverage, as does most individuals and businesses in this country and most others.  The villains of this story are the large depositors that chose to run these banks but didn't need the money.  It's all leverage, Sparky.  Every business. Most homeowners. Most college students.  Most options traders.  All leverage. If all leverage was called before term at the same time, the whole world would collapse.;;I totally agree with your rant.;;It’s 3am over here for me I read this twice now and only understand some of ur rant but hey I agree ☝️

10,stocks,Negative impact of generative AI on social media stocks like meta?,," I’m curious about your opinions on how generative AI will affect social media companies in the future. Generative AI is the technology that can create realistic images, videos, text, and audio based on some input or prompt. For example, you may have seen some websites that can generate fake faces or celebrities that look very convincing. In the near future, we may have entire fake influencers posting images and videos of themselves doing things when they don't even exist.

My question is: do you think generative AI will have a negative impact on social media stocks, because with so much AI generated content on the Internet, on platforms like Instagram people won’t even know what’s real and what’s fake and they will stop using it altogether? Or do you think people will still enjoy social media regardless of the authenticity of the content? Or maybe generative AI will create new opportunities for social media platforms to engage their users?

I’m interested in hearing your thoughts and arguments on this topic.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11v8ik7/negative_impact_of_generative_ai_on_social_media/,"Honestly?  I think we are nearing the downfall of social media apps.  It’s all becoming fake and wayyyy too over saturated.  We are seeing the algorithms blatantly forcing our attention, whereas before, we knew they were there but didn’t notice too much.

Hell, my twitter feed is now filled with political or AI newsletters/threads from people I don’t even know.  Facebook is filled with misinformation.  Instagram is filled with influencers and fake AI crap.  TikTok is being investigated for potential foreign spying.  Content is exploding like never before, and it’s all fake skill-less smeary nonsense that doesn’t mean anything.  Fake influencers, fake artwork, fake voices, fake photos, fake everything.  Why should we care about it anymore?

You’re right to wonder where this is all leading.  It’s like how NFTs just completely over saturated themselves and fizzled out.  Now we are seeing that with social media in general.  And quite frankly, that’s probably a good thing.  We could all use some time away from these attention hungry corporations.

11,stocks,AliBaba (BABA) valuation,Advice,"Pretty new to investing, I have a small portfolio of \~25k with Ford, DLTR, Google, Meta, VOO, and about 15% of BABA.

I got BABA around 90$ in December, with my thinking that they are consistently having strong earnings, have a large market and room for growth. Although I understand these are somewhat shallow reasons for buying a stock, I expected that my ideas would make sense.

Recently, they posted earnings, which were very strong and beat expectations. Naturally I thought that the stock would at least gain a few points, but despite their strong earnings and little news about the company, it's been tanking day after day.

How does a stock like this get evaluated? Is this just due to the volatility of the Chinese market or am I missing something bad about this company?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11uawl4/alibaba_baba_valuation/,"I'd avoid Chinese stocks, Economic cold war between US and China will only get worse

I think it's more sentiment with BABA, plus if you look at their margins, the effects of competition are apparent. There are a few Chinese stocks that if you bought in November would be up 75-100%. So it's both company selection, company specific sentiment as well as finding the oversold point. And a stomach for volatility is necessary.

The world is preparing for WW3 between US and China. I’m kind of dumping money in the naive hope it won’t happen and the knowledge it doesn’t matter where your money is if we decide to go to war. Europe is treating China very differently. But now they have to be friends with Biden because of Russia so they’re following a bit more. But the main difference is that Europe understands you don’t need to be #1 to live a #1 lifestyle. Americans have been on top for so long they fear China to an irrational level. So war is what we’re going to get.

Isn’t their core biz flattening or losing to competitors, ie the online commerce? 

Plus it’s a huge target to CCP to slap it. Hard to justify a DCF when the governing party are dictating the leaders at major companies and where they can deploy capital.;;There are multiple risks investing in BABA (Chinese stock)

First and the most important is the Chinese government who has a significant influence on the country's economy and financial markets. Changes in government policies, regulations, and restrictions can have a significant impact on BABA.

Also there is some concerns that some Chinese companies have been accused of fraudulent accounting practices, such as not reporting all of their revenues or inflating their profits. This can lead to significant losses for investors if the company's true financial position is not accurately reflected in its stock price.

No need to talk about Geopolitical risks and China's relationships with the United States… 

I will stay away from Chinese stocks for now."
12,stocks,"safe haven The stock market is red-eyed. At present, it is not only bank stocks but also energy stocks that are killing.",,"Market commentary has pointed out that last year's big tech stocks are now safe havens. The five elephant stocks then bucked the trend and rose:

GOOGL 2.28%

META 1.92%

MSFT 1.78%

AAPL 0.26%

The auto industry is currently in a recession, and TSLA will be affected, so it has been a little weak recently.

Chip design duo AMD and NVDA have not been dragged down by semiconductors and bucked the trend today. INTC came back from failure, rising 9.35% in the first five trading days.

# [Dow futures slip, regional bank shares drop: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/15/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Thursday as regional banks slid once again on growing fears of a crisis in banking within the U.S. and Europe.
*****
> Futures tied to the 30-stock index were down 94 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 futures were down 0.2%, while Nasdaq-100 futures traded up 0.3%.
*****
> Credit Suisse announced overnight it will borrow up to nearly $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank to assure short-term liquidity. That offered some relief to the embattled bank in extended hours after it fell to a record low Wednesday following reports that the Saudi National Bank, Credit Suisse’s largest investor, said it would not provide additional assistance. U.S.-listed shares gained 5% in extended trading after falling just under 14% in the prior session.
*****
> But the news was not enough to quell fears on Wall Street of an impending crisis, leading regional banks to take another leg down in Thursday’s premarket. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) slid 2.6% in extended trading, led down by a more than 26% drop in First Republic Bank.
*****
> “What’s also similar to ’08 is the hunting in the market for who’s the most weak next,” said Greg Fleming, CEO of Rockefeller Capital Management and former president of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” “And the proxy’s been uninsured deposits.”
*****
> Growing concern over Credit Suisse sent other European banking stocks lower and reverberated in U.S. markets beginning Wednesday. The Dow at one point Wednesday fell 725 points before ending the day down by 280.83 points, or 0.87% lower. The S&P 500 dropped 0.7%.
*****
> “It’s no doubt changing the landscape of how we as investors look at the investability of financial institutions that fit in the banking sector,” said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. “It also makes us ponder just how the sector would navigate with, in the future, more forms of regulatory pressure on these corporations.”
*****
> Traders will keep an eye out for key economic data, including the latest jobless claims report. Housing starts data from the U.S. Census Bureau is also out at 8:30 a.m. ET.

>Investors believe that if TikTok were to be banned in the U.S., social media companies like Snapchat and Meta would regain users lost to the short-form video platform.

>ByteDance said in a statement that ""If protecting national security is the objective, divestment doesn't solve the problem: a change in ownership would not impose any new restrictions on data flows or access.""

Meta blog post: https://about.fb.com/news/2023/03/mark-zuckerberg-meta-year-of-efficiency/

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a blog post on Tuesday that the company will lay off 10,000 employees as Meta continues to slim down and trim expenses in a challenging economy.

The new round of layoffs follow a previous round of cuts, announced in November, that affected over 11,000 workers, which equated to roughly 13% of Meta’s overall staff.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11r62p6/meta_to_lay_off_10000_more_workers_after_initial/,"I've seen it time and time again where these companies have a staff of glorified Teams meeting organizers.

16,ValueInvesting,"How ""Meta’s Year of Efficiency"" will affect the tech industry?",Discussion,"Mark Zuckerberg published a 7-page letter titled ""Meta's Year of Efficiency,"" in which he described the company's new culture and goals.

Highlights - 

* Restructuring plans focused on flattening our orgs, canceling lower priority projects, and reducing our hiring rates. 
* Reduce team size by around 10,000 people and to close around 5,000 additional open roles.
* Flatter is faster - **removing multiple layers of management.** As part of this, we will ask many managers to become individual contributors. 
* Leaner is better - Since we reduced our workforce last year, one surprising result is that many things have gone faster.
* **In-person time helps build relationships** and get more done.
* Another goal for the Year of Efficiency is to improve our business performance given the **new economic reality**.
* This new economic reality will **continue for many years.**
* Most companies will scale back their long term vision and investments.
*  Our **single largest investment is in advancing AI** and building it into every one of our products. 

You can see Elon and Twitter's influence on this letter and this letter will likely further strengthen this trend. Since I invest heavily in tech companies, I'm curious to hear other investors' thoughts on this move. What effect will it have on other companies in the sector and in general?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/11t4ofl/how_metas_year_of_efficiency_will_affect_the_tech/,"> In-person time helps build relationships and get more done

Ironic for a company that changed its name to focus on VR fantasy garbo :/. Wow.

Not sure I have an answer to your question but just find it hilarious;;I already made 70% on meta this year. It's now fairly priced in my opinion at 500 billion market capitalization. I wouldn't touch it here. I'll be back in later when it drops again.;;It might be the start of tech companies maturing into blue chip companies. They will start caring about traditional metrics like EPS and Profits and be more shareholders oriented. Maybe even starting to pay a dividend and cut significantly on stock compensation. 

For META specifically, I am personally happy as I bought at a discount and I am sittting on some nice profit, but Zuck is a clown and should resign. He renamed the entire company after a fad and is pulling a 180 barely one year after the rebrand. And now he is shilling the word ‘AI’ already… with nothing to show for it. The year of efficiency should also include him retiring if you ask me. That by itself would be a boost to the stock.;;The most important thing to understand as a value investor about the current economic environment is that rising rates force companies to become more efficient and productive. 

When rates are low companies, and particularly in tech can afford to hire lots of extra people and sort of have them sitting around not doing much. When the cheap money goes away the companies that pivot and clean out the unproductive workers first will be the ones who continue to post profits.

As a value investor you want to look for the companies that are beaten down in the market but are signaling through their leadership that they are leaning out but not scaling back. I have no love for Meta or Zuckerberg and I personally think the metaverse stuff is silly but I have to give him props that he has been unambiguous in setting the direction of getting rid of the crud so the profitability is still there.;;All this to pursue a metaverse no one needs or wants;;Silicon Valley Bank will have just as great of an impact on the sector.

In general earnings will rise as large tech companies cut costs and become more efficient. Some of this cost cutting will be from headcount reductions while some will be the result of lower compensation and bonus packages. Additional cost cutting will be from leaving non-core businesses. As for efficiency, you'll see more large companies force people back into the office to prevent them from goofing off or working multiple jobs. This pressure on employees will also take the form of keeping the most productive and valuable people while letting weaker hires go; as many of these weaker hires were brought on during the pandemic as a redundancy and insurance against losing employees to competitors or COVID.

The thing to focus on here is stock based comp and adjusted earnings while understanding that low interest rates allowed these large tech firms to compensate employees with stock that was expected to be an important part of their pay package. But now that rates are rising, these share prices won't rise as much, it at all, and will result in either more cash compensation for employees or reduced total compensation.

As it relates to Silicon Valley Bank, it'll be harder for non-public tech companies to finance thier operations towards potential future exits. This will probably result in bankruptcies for the weakest firms and fire sale acquisition prices for some of the better firms. For the best firms, they'll have to take down rounds like Stripe just did in order to get the cash they need for operations. In the case of Stripe, they needed a lot of cash to pay a tax bill due related to stock based compensation.

Eventually the large tech firms will be able to purchase some these firms at reasonable prices and potentially do acqui hires to get the talent they need. This will result in larger companies potentially buying assets that could be their next growth engine in the next bull run.

But regardless of what they do, companies like Apple are going to mean revert in price. And potentially mean revert in revenue as well.;;Let's be real, they're going to be hiring back about 20% as consultants at much higher rates and paying through the nose to staff aug companies to make up the rest.;;It's also a good opportunity for me to share my [portfolio](https://www.jika.io/u/Nadav%20Avrahami). I am seriously considering selling some tech stocks. Would love to hear your input.;;Marketing. we are doing great. Trust me, we are the most efficient company. We are yuge. So efficient.
