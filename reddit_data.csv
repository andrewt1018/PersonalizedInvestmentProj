1,wallstreetbets,A stocks supply chain,Discussion,"Do you guys inspect the supply chain of a stock?
For example: MSFT <- NVDA <- TSMC 

Or even go further as in constructing a whole web of supply chains between stocks?

What kind of useful data can be extracted from a supply chain to decide on the position for a stock?

Each stock has public data for net revenue and cost of goods sold. Is it possible to find more relevant data for the supply chain? For example, the fraction of revenue of NVDA that comes from cost of goods sold from MSFT?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11t9pp7/a_stocks_supply_chain/,">We do not need to inspect the supply chain because we are smarter than everyone else and can just look at the stock price.;;I think you're going to deep with it friend.

Well after the ECB still proceeded with a 50bps hike many would have thought that SPY would have a negative reaction today.. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2o5e17w6e6oa1.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9de8ee4821944df21ef5cb1b9506c9948569e5e5

But instead… we are left with what im calling incognito QE.

The big banks have stepped in an collectively along with the feds to basically prevent FRC from failing… this has officially become much like CS a “too big too fail” moment. Now whats interesting here and many are missing is that yes $2 trillion… yes trillion.. could be injected into the economy essentially to keep the banks from going under but this is a loan. This is not as easy as just printing free money… however, SPY today clearly heard “free money” and literally ran with it all day long. 

Tomorrow is quad witching day (this year is absolutely flying by!)… and with that we should absolutely expect some volatility. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oe0lbrp7e6oa1.png?width=523&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=541e26eea7960d9852473d5c5aeb5bab3e5ed0c4

With an average open of -0.98% on quad witching days… and with this in my opinion artificial run up today… I honestly would have been very tempted to run some over night puts. However, the option chains is absolutely weird right now… 

For instance, tomorrow (at market close) a 1dte call is about 0.98 while an atm put is 2.76… that’s over double of a difference. This mostly is related to the fact that call IV is only 18% and put IV is 35%... I do not really remember a time I have seen IV this different. 

Even looking at the 4 and 5 dte puts are nearly 2x of calls and that mostly is related to IV being nearly double on puts vs. calls. 

This tells me right now that the MM is heavily protected to the downside and the upside is a cheap hedge right now. 

I would expect to see this option chain correct itself in the near future here… IF the bank run issues are truly subsided. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1jqj8488e6oa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1e1530de070fe5944c8d85580562bc63f0f0527e

As I had said as long as bulls held 385.87 with the newly established demand (support) our upside target really should have been 394.68. Well today bulls officially pushed and took out that previous demand (was resistance). 

This now makes our daily chart WIDE open… we have a huge basically $20 trading range from 385.87 to 405.17. Current trend is up and realistically until we get a new supply (resistance) put in then we turly should be looking for an upside push to 405.17. Normally I would say theres no way we hit that tomorrow… however, the fact that SPY has put in its 4th $10 range day in the last 6 trading days its actually fully within possibilities that we hit that level tomorrow… 

Now in the chances that we reject here at the daily 20ema and double top and close red tomorrow there is a very good chance that this 396.2 will become a new supply (Resistance) and that would lead me to believe a retrace back to 385.87 is coming, at least until a new higher demand (Support) is established. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w3kzt8r8e6oa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d8c78cdf16525d1ccb2bd234f9f1e2734a4addca

Cleaned up our chart here a little bit… we broke through the falling wedge I had mentioned yesterday. We also more importantly broke out and closed over that 391.8 black channel resistance. This should as supply/ demand also mentions be an upside breakout trend. 

With the bulls finally reclaiming a close over the daily 8ema for the first time in 8 trading days… we should look for the bulls to close over the daily 20ema tomorrow. That would also signify further upside to be expected. 

IF you look here there actually that similar 385.8 to 405.2 channel that the supply/ demand shows. There is definitely a case and expectation that we could test 405.2 before we see a new resistance put in. 

However it also should be noted that since February 2nd we have been in a clear downtrend. The ultimate bull target for market close tomorrow is a closure over 400 to retake the daily 8, 20, 50, 100 and 200ema. That would in my opinion solidify (outside of new bad banking news) a breakout to 405+ leading into FOMC. Bears tomorrow ultimately going into the weekend need a closure back under 390.1 ideally and minimally back under 391.8 (daily 8ema). 

SPY Levels:  
 Supply- 405.17 -> 414.13  
 Demand- 385.87 -> 376.67  
 Daily support- 394.7 -> 391.8 -> 390.1  
 Daily Resistance- 396.1 -> 397.8 -> 399.7 -> 401.6

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Futures called this upside shot before SPY did but with 3895 holding as demand (support) until a new supply (resistance) is established realistically we should be looking for a push to 4055 supply (resistance). 

Until we tag 4055 or establish a new lower supply (resistance) we should continue to expect an upside push on Futures. Futures did however close over its daily 20ema which also signifies upside potential tomorrow. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

The more I look at this the more I actually see a potential large daily bear flag. If you follow the red resistance line down as long as bears can hold under that line and if they potentially can turn tomorrow into a double top off 3995 then we actually could see downside into next week. However, if the bulls close over 3995 tomorrow and especially if they can close us over 4013 then I truly do expect upside into next week. 

The bulls finally broke us out of that black channel and closed us over that and the daily 8/20ema. We however did hit a brick wall at 4000. 4000 if you look at the chart is definitely a major pivot point. If the bulls can close us over 4000 tomorrow that really should open up a push back to 4055-4095. However, if the bears can hold futures under 4000 at close and turn this into a double top I would target a retest of 3955.

Bulls minimally want a closure over 3970 tomorrow but ideally would like a closure over 4020. If the bears can break this back under 3955 tomorrow that would be an important level to signify possible downside for next week. 

Futures level:  
 Supply- 4055 -> 4160  
 Demand- 3895 -> 4095  
 Daily Support- 3975 -> 3955 -> 3920  
 Daily Resistance- 4000 -> 4020 -> 4055

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5s9slebae6oa1.png?width=834&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dce1835ab45f12df79c43cab4c68888dfde4b04c

The VIX continues to have extreme volatility and movement. For most of the day the VIX was able to hold that key 23.65 support level. However, by EOD it lost that support and now has closed back under its daily 8ema. Last support is at the 22 level which is the daily 20ema. However, with this bearish engulfing VIX candle this truly unless we get another double bottom is a bullish omen for the markets as a whole. 

As much as I do like downside and do believe that we wont see the 420s for a while… this black swan event has significantly fizzled out and for now is not going to be enough to take us down all the way. 

**DXY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/atituwqae6oa1.png?width=856&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f55209c69e364b6811354215887b3512758c1875

The dollar really didn’t do a whole lot of anything today… it just sort of fizzled around. However, it should be noted that it did not break through that 104.6 level but it also did not break back under the 104.3 support area. 

As you can see much like SPY there is a breakout triangle here on DXY… last time DXY/ 10YR set up a pattern with SPY when they broke SPY followed… keeping a close eye here on DXY to see which way it goes. 

**10YR YIELD**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4fnwex4ce6oa1.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dd8e0c1d3cd3928acd675138815a9f1638086319

The 10YR is finding “support” as in we have finally found a level mostly on SPY and a level of fear that people would rather take a risk in the markets then they would in bonds. 

This shows me today and I mentioned this is what happened on Tuesday also that the “fear” unwound and people left the safety of the bond market. Now the interesting thing here is that the very next day as you can see fear immediately spiked. So while we have now put out the first for Credit Suisse and now apparently FRC… there are many banks left that are still not in a good place. I actually would not be surprised tomorrow to see the 10yr rate drop again due to some new fear. 

This 3.39% area is where even back to January and February we seem to see the pivot from safety back to risk on. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xqsag6pce6oa1.png?width=325&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d89c4e89d744572a492881eafed1fcafd1574abc

I actually talked about this a little bit yesterday but I mentioned that TECH as a whole looked incredibly stronger than SPY looked. Why is that? Well in my opinion people think tech is beaten down over the last year. People thing that “big tech” is too big too fall and that there is safety in TECH. Now is a company like Apple, Msft, or google going to go out of business? Absolutely not (probably) as long as the CEO doesn’t do something absolutely stupid… 

However, are these companies “fool proof” and “recession proof?” Absolutely not. For instance, the last true recession in 07-09 the Nasdaq actually fell 56% and SPY fell 57%. Which is quite interesting because year to date through end of February the NASD is actually up 9.5% compared to 3.7% for SPY. 

Who has more room to fall in a true market crash/ recession? 

Now some more perspective here is that 10 years post the 07/09 recession Apple was up 900%, Amazon 2000%, MSFT 400% and even Netflix was up 5000%+. So in a way it does make sense to see people pile into these tech giants because well some day they’ll get their investment back.. however, its like they always say… tech is the last domino to fall… This sudden rush to tech very well could be the final signal. 

For now it appears we have avoided the black swan and financial collapse of 2023… however, like anything nothing happens immediately and its never straight down… ive said since 2022 that the bottom (outside of a black swan event) is likely in and I have also said we are unlike to see any significant new 52 week high until at least 2025. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

Honestly today was just an annoying trading day. Just ended up trading against myself and catching every stop loss hunt it seems. I wasn’t able to rid any of that massive ride up from 1015 to 1145. I attempted to time a reversal only to get stopped out. 

From there I was able to grab quite a few small wins and at one point had even crawled myself back to breakeven. Only to get stop loss hunted twice on calls. 

Days like today (and really yesterday) are highly frustrating for me to trade. Today was not a technical based rally it wasn’t even momentum it was algo fueled FOMO pushing us higher on “good” news. Days like the last two days are nearly impossible to trade well (at least for my established and well tested strategy) because it does not truly follow technical. 

Was there money to be made? Yes… did I have some wins? Absolutely. But I honestly woulda been better off just stopping after my first two trades of the day when I saw that massive 1015 to 1145 am rally and realized what type of day we were going to have…

One thing that I always preach is that we do not have to trade every day. We also do not have to trade every single set up. If you have a well established strategy that you have tried in numerous markets… you learn the limits of that strategy. For me today I knew I was pushing my limit of my strategy. While I did put in a small red day I have had a good enough rest of the week to make up for it and still look to close out another green week. 

However, one thing I definitely recommend is if you can tell… which I mentioned very early on that I knew this was going to be a tough day to trade for my strategy/rules… there is nothing wrong with taking the day off. Remember there are 252 trading days in a year.. you are better off walking away with a small loss or even net zero day versus over trading and putting yourself in a position that will take longer to recover and get back into the green.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11t839r/incognito_qe_and_quad_witching_day_31623_spy_es/,"The reason puts are much more expensive than calls is because tomorrow is ex-dividend on SPY (dividend is 1.78);;The Irish won't be the only thing green tomorrow!;;I think FOMC is going to bring us down, JPow will have to address the FED balance sheet rebound and it’s impact on inflation.

6,stocks,Keep portfolio / Sell portfolio and put all into Term Deposits. What would you do?,Advice Request,"Hi guys! I'm looking for some advice / points of view on something. For the last couple of weeks i've been thinking and thinking what i should do with my portfolio / investment strategy. So, I'm from Europe, and i currently have some money invested into the US market + some spare money (I'll show the percentages below). Right know, i have some spare money and i have the possibility to it into some Term deposits with maturity from 1 month, up to 3 years, which i think pays out quite good or just keep DCA into the market.

Ok so first, my portfolio right now is still positive overall and it looks like this: VOO - 25%, QQQ - 18%, NVDA - 12%, AAPL - 11%, MSFT - 10%, GOOGL - 7%, RKLB - 3%, UNH - 3% and the rest 11% split into V, ASTS, MA, HD, AMZN, TGT, DIS, BA and TSLA. For the past year or so, i didn't add anything to individual stocks and just DCA into VOO/QQQ every month.

Now, the banks right now have these interests (i've selected from different banks, the best ones for each maturity period): 1 month - 5.7%, 3 months - 7.3%, 6 months - 7.5%, 1 year - 8.2%, 2 years - 8.45%, 3 years - 8.7%. But before you say holy s\*\*t, these are good returns, right now, here, the inflation rate is at 15% (which in reality i think it's even worse), so it's not that great if you look at it that way.

Looking at the market right now, 7.5% or 8.2% seems pretty good. I know the market average return is around 8% to 9% but I'm not sure the market is gonna have these kind of returns (at least the next few years?). But i could be right, i could be wrong of course. I just don't feel like it's gonna do great next period, that's all.

So now back to my dilemma... As i said, for the past year i just DCA each month into VOO/QQQ. Besides what's already invested, i have some spare cash i would like to deploy right now and i see these scenarios.

\- Sell the portfolio, and put it all + spare money + new money each month into term deposits (6 months or 1 year maturity)

\- Keep portfolio as it is and put spare money + new money each month into term deposits

\- Keep portfolio and put the spare money into it + DCA each month as usual and ignore the term deposits

If i missed something, maybe a better option or some information that i missed and might be really important to take into consideration, please tell me. Right now i'm something like 60/40 into second scenario. Just don't touch the portfolio, but put the rest of the money into these deposits (i was thinking the 1 year one may be the best one ?), until the market stabilizes a bit. Also, im in my twenties, so my investment hold period is long. I don't need the money any time soon (that's 1 of the reason why i think the option to keep DCA into the market may be better because of the compound interest?).

I could really use some advice on this guys. What would you do in this situation? Sorry if some terms are not right or something, as im not from US, some things related to investing may be different and i might wrongly translate them. Thanks a lot guys!

TLDR: You have spare money right now. How you choose to use it?

8,dividends,Anyone else value long term dividend growth over immediate payouts?,Discussion,"I see many posts of people utilizing $JEPI and $SCHD, which are great for dividend income. However, I am someone who is focused on long term results from growth companies who pay ultra low dividends (around 1%) and wants the supreme growth and return from valuable companies. I believe that for someone in my scenario, it would be better to invest in growth stocks that pay a very low dividend and just let it do its magic over time. Mathematically, it is reasonable to expect that in several years, the growth stocks' dividends will exceed the amount of what you would get more than utilizing high dividend stocks.

Instead of one investing into JEPI and SCHD generating 10% to 15% average returns, positions in $AAPL, $SPGI, and even $MSFT (20%+ returns) would eventually generate more dividends than the former choice and enough equity to utilize leverage safely. Patience is a virtue here as the snowball effect is a factor.

&#x200B;

I believe $JEPI and $SCHD are good tools for generating income when needed such as for retirement or leveraging, but for some of us younger folks, growth stocks are the way for the super long term.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/11uss55/anyone_else_value_long_term_dividend_growth_over/,"Not to mention some people dont like the single stock risk of picking single companies;;I think you misunderstand:
SCHD is for mid term and long term growth. 
 
JEPI is more for immediate payouts

Both are completely different vehicles.;;I’m heavily invested in AAPL and MSFT, but I view them with less growth potential based on their size, age, market share/saturation, etc. compared to more pure-play growth stocks.;;I’ve been told and lectured that while i’m young I should be taking on more risks and aggressively invest while I can versus when i’m old. 

With that in mind.. I use that as a doctrine when I invest. I have a mix of growth and a mix of risky stocks. My mix of risky is JEPI/JEPQ, MAIN, O and ARCC. My mix of growth SCHD/VTI. The former holds 20% weight and the latter 80%. 

I am ready to be downvoted to oblivion lol.;;The investors jumping on JEPI are penny wise and pound foolish. Dividends are a long game and solid companies that have a good dividend growth should outperform things like JEPI in the long run. 

Just last year QYLD was the talk of this sub with high yield and monthly payouts but as many pointed out no growth. Now nobody brings them up and have moved onto JEPI as the new flavor of the month.

I’ll stick with MSFT, UNP, PEP, SNA etc.;;Disagree with you lumping SCHD with jepi completely different 

My biggest position is msft which I am all about the div and capital growth over the next 20+ years;;Remember to also weigh in total dividend payouts over time.  Some may grow fast but not overtake a high yielder in total divs paid out over time.  It depends on the timeframe and rate of growth and initial yield.  This is easily modeled in sheets/excel.;;Utilize leverage safely? That seems contradictory.

Can you give an example of how one can achieve this;;Compound interest is also great for long term growth.;;JEPI is for income, SCHD is for dividend growth;;I think I approach dividend investing in a slightly different way then most people. I not really concerned with retirement as there is alway that chance of simply not make it. Instead I invest to improve my life as it exist today. 

For example, I am planning on dumping my Tax Return into JEPI. Which should get me about 20 ish a month, this directly translates into me being able to eat at my favorite sandwich place for “free” once a month. Even if my budget slims down for that month I will likely not need to forgo my Gyro or dip into any long term savings. 

I am in a really good place right now financial and that won’t last. Not that I will make much less money but will have increase expenses. Having a dividend profile giving me additional income will offsite that and help maintain my current lifestyle.;;So you want to invest in stocks that may pay out dividends in the future? That's not ""dividend growth."" That's just growth stocks. 

If you're looking at that far into the future, then you're safer to invest into index funds like VOO or some other more focused on a particular type of growth stocks.

Individual stocks like MSFT or AAPL may look great now and have performed great in the past, but that doesn't guarantee they'll keep performing like that over the next 10-20 years. Each of them is one bad CEO decision away from tanking (ex. Facebook and their whole Meta gamble that screwed them over).;;I like those type of companies as well.  My portfolio is mostly composed of higher dividend payers but I do add in some stocks like AOS, GOOGL (in hopes they start paying a dividend), AAPL etc.  Looking to add some LRCX or ASML as well.  I'm close to retirement so income is more important but I think even nearing retirement it is good to have some good dividend growers.   Still looking to add DOV and AVGO.;;JEPI has nuanced use case and can be a small part of a portfolio. During volatile markets the distributions will be bigger.;;There is no one size fits all strategy. You have to work out your goals and the lifestyle you want and then build your investments towards that. As long as you understand the pros and cons of the strategy chosen you will be fine.

I’m a fan of dividend growth - so yes I don’t know why so many young investors with long investing time horizon are using JEPI.  

I’m not saying to pile into these stocks now - you have to do the research but they’re just a few examples of companies sporting excellent dividend growth and have performed really well….total return!  

TSCO - MS - AVGO - HD - LOW - SPGI - PXD - V - MA - TXN - UNH … etc, etc

So I focus much more on dividend growth rather than high dividends.;;Yes part of my portfolio is in DGI stocks. I started that strategy in 2021.

12,ValueInvesting,Is Return on Equity the best way to check if something is a wonderful business?,Discussion,"So Warren Buffett says it's important to ""buy a wonderful business at a fair price, rather than a fair business at a wonderful price""

I was watching some of the older videos and he mentions a business having a consistently high return on equity (above 20%) for many years. Is this correct?

Case in point: I was interested in GNW. The reason is this:

If I check their intrinsic value, I think their price should be around 20 dollars when they are at around 6 right now. However:

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GNW/genworth-financial/roe](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GNW/genworth-financial/roe)

ROE is 5% for many years. Meaning this is a cigar butt company.

However, looking at Microsoft:

A fair value is around 280 dollars when they are trading around 250. And so:

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MSFT/microsoft/roe](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MSFT/microsoft/roe)

ROE is like 40% for many years. This would be a wonderful company then right?

&#x200B;",https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/11pkivs/is_return_on_equity_the_best_way_to_check_if/,"Consistently high ROE over the last decade or more equates to high growth potential in the future. It tells you if they’re able to generate meaningful earnings efficiently from/against total equity. 

Buffet cares about consistent ROE and Earnings per share, because ROE is the growth potential and EPS is the yield or return of the underlying company per share. Think of a company like a variable rate bond. The EPS against the share price is the immediate return, dividends, share buybacks increase the face value and returns, and so will future growth. It’s also important to look at owners earnings historically to make sure the company really is generating meaningful cash flow. 

You can use EPS and ROE and book value growth to ballpark growth into the future. Using the long term median and average P/E ratios you can create a range of value and guess how much ROE or where P/E would need to be in 10 years do so in order to determine the likelihood of obtaining a CAGR of your desire in the future based on todays share price. Helps you figure out how realistic a certain gain may be or growth needed to organically/reasonably support a future share price.

You want consistently and high numbers, like ROE > 20% or 30% for the last decade through 2019, because that company is likely to continue to generate growth efficiently over the next ten if it has a durable competitive advantage. Consistency is easy to understand, the less bumps in the road the less guesswork and or the less justifications you need to make. The simpler the analysis due to a company’s track record, the greater the likelihood things won’t go wrong. If you see high ROE Is since 2020, ignore it and move on. If ROE is extremely low, but only in the current year, check the 10-k and news, maybe this is an industry thing and you’re looking at an undervalued company with good Long term prospects. But you have to determine if it’s a one-off event or future of the company.

Buffet relies on the process of elimination, consistency, and easy to understand operations, and a durable competitive advantage, because they help make a buy make business sense. The more consistent the numbers the more efficient the process is, the more reliable the data, and you spend less energy and time thinking about it. The value just screams at you, as Munger has discussed. If it’s not, it’s not worth going for. 

Investing like Buffet is more like selective hunting with a spear, not fishing. It’s not buy any company and wait 30 years and see, it’s more like wait patiently until a panic, lawsuit, or any bad news makes the market sell to unreasonable points given the business’ condition, and use your analysis and understanding to take advantage of the situation.

Buffet approaches investing like a horse handicapper. Purely the process of elimination. You can have two horses (companies) get sick, and the new owners are upset they can’t race this year, so they decide to sell them off for 80% less than what they bought them for last week. Do you pick the sick horse that lost every race it was in? Or do you pick the winning horse with a gold track record? More than likely, the winning horse will get over its sickness, and will win races again in the future. So you buy the better of the two and benefit next year at the races.

This is literally value investing like Buffet. Waiting for bad news and buying up the best businesses when the news has no impact on the long term economics of the business. That’s why consistent historical growth (ROE) and earnings (EPS) are key to value investing. So is understanding Capex, working capital needs, and whether or not said company can continue to generate its products efficiently in the future, or if they’re in such a competitive industry that they have to expend a great deal of capital to stay on top. That could also diminish your potential returns, when they could be buying back shares or paying dividends, etc. things that enhance your shares.

Some of the best value buys are companies like Coke or PepsiCo, who have to spend very little time and money to change their future processes to remain competitive. They’ve been making the same things for a hundred years with little change, and will do the same 100 years from now. Compare that to Tesla or Intel, and you’ll see the difference between product branding by a strong business with a durable competitive advantage, and a sickly price competitive business  that sees its margins and retained earnings shrink from competitive pressure, because the products they offer can be substituted elsewhere.;;ROIC is a better measure. ROE can be manipulated by capital structure;;It's one of the best ways. Why?

-The balance sheet is the future. The income statement is the past. The balance sheet is ""what we own"" and the income statement is ""this is the money we made from what we own"".  Keep that in mind whenever you read financial statements. 

-ROE=g over a long enough timeframe. Companies will grow in line with what their ROE is. Growth comes from reinvesting FCF at that ROE at rates higher than CoC.

-ROE is sensitive to leverage. You need to know if ROE is high due to leverage and if management is good at managing a levered company. Some management teams are really good at it. Some aren't. You need to figure that out.;;Why is ROE so low at GNW and so high at Microsoft? 

When you read their 10Ks, what jumps out at you that makes each business high or low quality?

And your intrinsic value estimates seem very audacious.;;I prefer return on invested capital and especially if you can compare roic over time. RoE tells you both how good the business is, and also how well capitalized the company is. Roic is more specific - what return does the company get on each dollar it invests?;;Try to perform a dupont analysis on the company. Its a way to decompose the ROE statistic into its main drivers (and then you can see where the lower relative metric comes from)

But i have to say that an ROE comparison between Microsoft and a life insurance company, better to compare comparable companies. Software is a high return sector, hence why its so expensive;;Decompose ROE but use ROIC as the holy grail. What they teach in MBA CFA and all the 400 investing books i own. Also what McKinsey gets paid for. Telling companies how to boost nopat/ic. Roe can he gamed too much;;ROE can be easily manipulated using different accounting measures, same with most spot check stats in finance. Ironically IMO P/E is actually still one of the most useful metrics for almost all business models, people like to overcomplicate things and FCF ROCE ROIC ETC but unless you understand the business deeply its easy to misconstrue things using these metrics. I always just read income statement, balance sheet and cashflow statement rather than rely on manipulatable metrics.;;[The importance of book value has diminshed because of stock buybacks in recent years.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/rohe3f/can_you_value_companies_by_their_roe_growth/)

I would not consider the ROE anymore for that reason, many companies now have almost no Equity and thus have sky-high ROE-numbers, I doubt those are the companies Buffet was referring to. 

Personally I look at the the ""Ebit / Tangible Assets"" to see how well a company is applying its capital, and I look for trends in this number over time.

There are others like ROIC, ROA, ROCE etc that I think are slightly better than the ROE.;;A Wonderful business should have amazing gross margin.

Just buy VOO and chill. You'll get burned by the markets otherwise. That's the only way to succeed imo. IMHO.;;Returns on *incremental* capital and reinvestment runway are far more important. It's very important to distinguish between historical and future returns on capital.
