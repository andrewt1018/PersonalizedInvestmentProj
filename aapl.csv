Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Below is an excerpt explaining the near term issue for some banks and the longer issue for any that take advantage of the asset swaps:

""Insured deposits are the stickiest because they are protected if things go wrong. So Ms Jiang and co-authors looked at uninsured cash. They found that if half of such deposits were to be withdrawn, the remaining assets and equity of 190 American banks would not be enough to cover the rest of their deposits. These banks currently hold $300bn in insured deposits.The newfound ability to swap assets at face value, under the Bank Term Funding Programme, at least makes it easier for banks to pay out depositors. But even this is only a temporary solution. For the Fed’s new facility is something of a confidence trick itself. The programme will prop up struggling banks only so long as depositors think it will. Borrowing through the facility is done at market rates of around 4.5%. This means that if the interest income a bank earns on its assets is below that—and its low-cost deposits leave—the institution will simply die a slow death from quarterly net-interest income losses, rather than a quick one brought about by a bank run."";;The size and speed of these bond moves is a little unnerving.;;Made 1k on Goog in a month so am gonna take the win for now... most of my money is in a fund I never trade so that's kinda new for me;;Bulls: Bears are stupid.

Tbh everyday I’m trying to convince myself to diversify internationally, but it just seems like markets everywhere outside the US are anemic.

International stocks may look cheap compared to SPY but maybe they’re cheap for a reason;;How long before digital monkey pictures make a comeback?;;It’s interesting how the Fed’s $300b bailout of the banks and the Swiss Fed’s $50b bailout of Credit Suisse have had such different effects on the market.

Why are European markets trailing US by 5-6% this week when proportionately, the $300b injected here should have less of a stimulating effect than the $50b there? Shouldn’t the proportionately larger sum injected in Europe cause European markets to surge faster than SPY?

Take a look at oil in the mid 60s.

Take a look at the 2-year down over a 100 basis points. This level of volatility in the fixed market is the equivalent of a VIX at 75 in the equities market.

Could someone please explain the second paragraph about delta hedging in simple terms:

> Some might wonder why a banking crisis is hitting oil so hard, as it is unlikely to impact crude demand and production. But during periods of elevated volatility, investors tend to pull out of risky assets like oil and invest in safer corners of the market. Oil prices have been very sensitive to the recent shift in risk sentiment, particularly due to the lack of supportive price fundamentals, with US oil inventories building this year.

> What is intensifying the drop in prices is the options market, through so-called delta hedging. Financial institutions sold downside protection instruments (put options) to oil market players, for instance producers. With the oil price falling below the level where the protection kicks in (strike level), those financial institutions now need to avoid having a price risk on their balance sheets. So, they are selling crude futures to offset the risks, amplifying the rout.

So financial institutions sold puts to oil producers, say at a strike price of $80 a barrel. A put option gives the put-buyer the option to sell the underlying asset to the put-writer at the strike price before some expiration date. Say the market price falls to $75 a barrel. This means that the oil producer can sell oil at $80 to the financial firm, forcing the firm to buy oil at $5 more than the real market price. If prices fall even more, the firm takes even bigger losses.

The firm wants to offset this risk. So it sells crude futures. Can someone explain the exact details of how this works? (What would be the price of the sale? Would it be higher or lower than the current market price? Who gets the right to buy/sell?);;Whoever is selling ENPH, please keep it up.

7,stocks,"safe haven The stock market is red-eyed. At present, it is not only bank stocks but also energy stocks that are killing.",,"Market commentary has pointed out that last year's big tech stocks are now safe havens. The five elephant stocks then bucked the trend and rose:

GOOGL 2.28%

META 1.92%

MSFT 1.78%

AMZN 1.39%

AAPL 0.26%

The auto industry is currently in a recession, and TSLA will be affected, so it has been a little weak recently.

Chip design duo AMD and NVDA have not been dragged down by semiconductors and bucked the trend today. INTC came back from failure, rising 9.35% in the first five trading days.

One strategy is to only buy stocks that have risen sharply rather than stocks that have fallen sharply, because from the lessons of last year, we can understand that thunderstorms have no bottom. Even META TSLA has experienced a collapse of more than 70% from its high point.

8,stocks,Keep portfolio / Sell portfolio and put all into Term Deposits. What would you do?,Advice Request,"Hi guys! I'm looking for some advice / points of view on something. For the last couple of weeks i've been thinking and thinking what i should do with my portfolio / investment strategy. So, I'm from Europe, and i currently have some money invested into the US market + some spare money (I'll show the percentages below). Right know, i have some spare money and i have the possibility to it into some Term deposits with maturity from 1 month, up to 3 years, which i think pays out quite good or just keep DCA into the market.

Ok so first, my portfolio right now is still positive overall and it looks like this: VOO - 25%, QQQ - 18%, NVDA - 12%, AAPL - 11%, MSFT - 10%, GOOGL - 7%, RKLB - 3%, UNH - 3% and the rest 11% split into V, ASTS, MA, HD, AMZN, TGT, DIS, BA and TSLA. For the past year or so, i didn't add anything to individual stocks and just DCA into VOO/QQQ every month.

Now, the banks right now have these interests (i've selected from different banks, the best ones for each maturity period): 1 month - 5.7%, 3 months - 7.3%, 6 months - 7.5%, 1 year - 8.2%, 2 years - 8.45%, 3 years - 8.7%. But before you say holy s\*\*t, these are good returns, right now, here, the inflation rate is at 15% (which in reality i think it's even worse), so it's not that great if you look at it that way.

Looking at the market right now, 7.5% or 8.2% seems pretty good. I know the market average return is around 8% to 9% but I'm not sure the market is gonna have these kind of returns (at least the next few years?). But i could be right, i could be wrong of course. I just don't feel like it's gonna do great next period, that's all.

So now back to my dilemma... As i said, for the past year i just DCA each month into VOO/QQQ. Besides what's already invested, i have some spare cash i would like to deploy right now and i see these scenarios.

\- Sell the portfolio, and put it all + spare money + new money each month into term deposits (6 months or 1 year maturity)

\- Keep portfolio as it is and put spare money + new money each month into term deposits

\- Keep portfolio and put the spare money into it + DCA each month as usual and ignore the term deposits

If i missed something, maybe a better option or some information that i missed and might be really important to take into consideration, please tell me. Right now i'm something like 60/40 into second scenario. Just don't touch the portfolio, but put the rest of the money into these deposits (i was thinking the 1 year one may be the best one ?), until the market stabilizes a bit. Also, im in my twenties, so my investment hold period is long. I don't need the money any time soon (that's 1 of the reason why i think the option to keep DCA into the market may be better because of the compound interest?).

I could really use some advice on this guys. What would you do in this situation? Sorry if some terms are not right or something, as im not from US, some things related to investing may be different and i might wrongly translate them. Thanks a lot guys!

TLDR: You have spare money right now. How you choose to use it? Sell portfolio and put everything into Term deposits (at least for the next couple of years) / Keep portfolio and put rest into Term deposits / Ignore the Term deposits and keep DCA into the market as usual.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11qdthr/keep_portfolio_sell_portfolio_and_put_all_into/,"8.2% is quite good I will put everything there.;;Those interest rates seem super high, do you have any examples of the banks you have selected?"

10,dividends,Anyone else value long term dividend growth over immediate payouts?,Discussion,"I see many posts of people utilizing $JEPI and $SCHD, which are great for dividend income. However, I am someone who is focused on long term results from growth companies who pay ultra low dividends (around 1%) and wants the supreme growth and return from valuable companies. I believe that for someone in my scenario, it would be better to invest in growth stocks that pay a very low dividend and just let it do its magic over time. Mathematically, it is reasonable to expect that in several years, the growth stocks' dividends will exceed the amount of what you would get more than utilizing high dividend stocks.

Instead of one investing into JEPI and SCHD generating 10% to 15% average returns, positions in $AAPL, $SPGI, and even $MSFT (20%+ returns) would eventually generate more dividends than the former choice and enough equity to utilize leverage safely. Patience is a virtue here as the snowball effect is a factor.

&#x200B;

I believe $JEPI and $SCHD are good tools for generating income when needed such as for retirement or leveraging, but for some of us younger folks, growth stocks are the way for the super long term.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/11uss55/anyone_else_value_long_term_dividend_growth_over/,"Not to mention some people dont like the single stock risk of picking single companies;;I think you misunderstand:
SCHD is for mid term and long term growth. 
 
JEPI is more for immediate payouts

Both are completely different vehicles.;;I’ve been told and lectured that while i’m young I should be taking on more risks and aggressively invest while I can versus when i’m old. 

With that in mind.. I use that as a doctrine when I invest. I have a mix of growth and a mix of risky stocks. My mix of risky is JEPI/JEPQ, MAIN, O and ARCC. My mix of growth SCHD/VTI. The former holds 20% weight and the latter 80%. 

I am ready to be downvoted to oblivion lol.;;I’m heavily invested in AAPL and MSFT, but I view them with less growth potential based on their size, age, market share/saturation, etc. compared to more pure-play growth stocks.;;JEPI is for income, SCHD is for dividend growth;;The investors jumping on JEPI are penny wise and pound foolish. Dividends are a long game and solid companies that have a good dividend growth should outperform things like JEPI in the long run. 

Just last year QYLD was the talk of this sub with high yield and monthly payouts but as many pointed out no growth. Now nobody brings them up and have moved onto JEPI as the new flavor of the month.

I’ll stick with MSFT, UNP, PEP, SNA etc.;;Disagree with you lumping SCHD with jepi completely different 

My biggest position is msft which I am all about the div and capital growth over the next 20+ years;;Utilize leverage safely? That seems contradictory.

Can you give an example of how one can achieve this;;So you want to invest in stocks that may pay out dividends in the future? That's not ""dividend growth."" That's just growth stocks. 

If you're looking at that far into the future, then you're safer to invest into index funds like VOO or some other more focused on a particular type of growth stocks.

Individual stocks like MSFT or AAPL may look great now and have performed great in the past, but that doesn't guarantee they'll keep performing like that over the next 10-20 years. Each of them is one bad CEO decision away from tanking (ex. Facebook and their whole Meta gamble that screwed them over).;;Remember to also weigh in total dividend payouts over time.  Some may grow fast but not overtake a high yielder in total divs paid out over time.  It depends on the timeframe and rate of growth and initial yield.  This is easily modeled in sheets/excel.;;Compound interest is also great for long term growth.;;I like those type of companies as well.  My portfolio is mostly composed of higher dividend payers but I do add in some stocks like AOS, GOOGL (in hopes they start paying a dividend), AAPL etc.  Looking to add some LRCX or ASML as well.  I'm close to retirement so income is more important but I think even nearing retirement it is good to have some good dividend growers.   Still looking to add DOV and AVGO.;;JEPI has nuanced use case and can be a small part of a portfolio. During volatile markets the distributions will be bigger.;;There is no one size fits all strategy. You have to work out your goals and the lifestyle you want and then build your investments towards that. As long as you understand the pros and cons of the strategy chosen you will be fine.

An income strategy at any age is perfectly fine. The price for freedom and flexibility is perhaps worth the 1-2% less in total returns.;;I think I approach dividend investing in a slightly different way then most people. I not really concerned with retirement as there is alway that chance of simply not make it. Instead I invest to improve my life as it exist today. 

For example, I am planning on dumping my Tax Return into JEPI. Which should get me about 20 ish a month, this directly translates into me being able to eat at my favorite sandwich place for “free” once a month. Even if my budget slims down for that month I will likely not need to forgo my Gyro or dip into any long term savings. 

I am in a really good place right now financial and that won’t last. Not that I will make much less money but will have increase expenses. Having a dividend profile giving me additional income will offsite that and help maintain my current lifestyle.;;You can keep SCHD as part of your portfolio and even mix it up with either VOO, SCHG or QQQM…and add stocks as you need.  

I’m a fan of dividend growth - so yes I don’t know why so many young investors with long investing time horizon are using JEPI.  

I’m not saying to pile into these stocks now - you have to do the research but they’re just a few examples of companies sporting excellent dividend growth and have performed really well….total return!  

TSCO - MS - AVGO - HD - LOW - SPGI - PXD - V - MA - TXN - UNH … etc, etc

So I focus much more on dividend growth rather than high dividends.;;Yes part of my portfolio is in DGI stocks. I started that strategy in 2021. But it’s best for young people and I am no spring chicken. I was happy to grab a few things like PH, ROP when they were low in October.;;SCHD and JEPI are two very different ETF’s. SCHD is blue chip dividend slow growth stocks and isn’t even close to 10% dividend. JEPI is a covered call high dividend income stock. Apples and oranges.;;Yes. WSM, WING, PNC, CAH.;;I didn’t know growth stocks dividends will exceed the dividends from high dividend stocks. Good to know.

So if you want high dividend in the future, you need to invest in growth now?;;I have a good amount of SCHD, but lean heavily towards growth, specifically dividend growth. Mostly VOO, a little QQQM and some individuals like MSFT, HD, PEP etc.;;I am very near retirement. So, I have my income portfolio setup focused on immediate pay-out with a minority of my positions with a dividend growth slant;;Some stocks are growers some stocks are showers.

While most of my dividends are growers there can be an argument made for a higher starting dividend because of the gains that can be made while waiting for the grower to catch up.;;I too am mostly in VTI and SCHD. I also have SCHG and costco who also have dividends but very small amounts to add ontop of their growth. A couple of high dividend stocks like O and HBAN for some addicting dividends. I've only been investing for a year and half and bought alot of my shares at ATH so I'm currently DCA down and am looking forward to seeing how each of these stocks compound over the next decade.;;I have high dividends, growth stocks and mostly high dividend growers. I’ve set up an account with high dividend growers and I have a 15 year plan to achieve the monthly income I want. Growth stocks are great but if the market tanks 20-50% during your retirement you don’t want to be selling shares to survive.;;Learned about this company not to terribly long ago, Just opened a small position in SPGI.;;was thinking the same thing, but i would prefer etfs to single stocks, can you recommend some?  
currently i'm thinking DGRO as main position, and VIG/SCHD as supplements;;I am one of those investors that like a mix of High Dividend Low Growth (above 4% yield) mid dividend yield mid growth (schd) and low yield high growth like $V $MA $MSFT $AAPL. With this approach my base is SCHD, DGRO, VOO, XLK that covers a lot of broad exposure to growth and value and then I will sprinkle in about 20% of other companies I like between the HYLG, LYHG, or MYMG strategies;;I follow a similar approach (I am in my 50s), but the best performing stocks are in the top two deciles of  dividend payers and growers long term - upto around 2.5% I think.

[S](https://www.hartfordfunds.com/insights/market-perspectives/equity/the-power-of-dividends.html)o along with ZTS, TMO, SPGI and MSFT I own HD and LMT as well.;;So many interesting responses and opinions in this thread.  Some thoughts:
- follow the data and performance of what you are investing in.
- personally, I am increasingly a sector funds type of person.  Individual stocks make up less and less of my portfolio.
- if you are buy and hold for 10+ years, then you really have to look at total return which considers both dividends paid plus share price change over the measured time period.  
- as a result, you care less about dividends and income.  
- in the past several decades, technology, health care, defense have given the best total returns 
- if you believe that trend will continue over the next 30 years, that is where you should invest.  Hands down.
- if you are not a buy and hold type of person, can not stand the swings of the market, need passive income, or that other sectors will outperform those listed above, your investment should lie elsewhere

Short story, determine your holding time period and if you can stomach the swings of the market.  Come to terms with those two things, and then develop a investment strategy."
11,dividends,"If you had to pick just a few index funds to hold for life, what would you pick?",Discussion,"I have been recently selling all my individual holdings, all I have left now is VOO, SCHD, as well as holdings in O, AAPL, TSM, and MSFT) VOO&SCHD collectively make up the larger percentage of my portfolio. 

I think i’m just going to index and chill, for the next ~30 years. Stock picking is fun and exciting, but I’m too busy to constantly be worrying about companies financials. It was very fun for the first couple of years investing, but I think now, for simplicity’s sake, I’m going to just stick with a couple of index funds and get broadly diversified through that.

What is your time horizon. If you’ve got a long time left Id take a small position in a growth ETF like BST or BIGZ.

Personally id ditch O. I’d do some research on private property investment groups in your area. I would invest your O capital in a local private corporate real estate management group. A lot of people love REITs, I’m not sold on them and I am not a fan of unqualified dividends. I’d rather be able to tangibly see what properties I have ownership in and how they are being used. Personal preference though.;;I agree - I’m predominantly using ETFs with some stocks but I keep individual stocks to a limited %.  I couldn’t resist though and picked up some financials with SCHW and WAL after some big dips.  

I also use a bit of ETFs for special targeted exposure such as XSD for semiconductors rather than me picking a select few companies.  

So yes!  - there’s a thrill for a while with picking stocks but then it becomes high maintenance putting you thru a roller coaster ride and it plays with your mind as you constantly think about whether you made the right investment…and the constant market mix of bad news & good news that changes like the weather plays tricks on you.  

The handful of stocks I hold are mostly high quality, durable, blue-chip long-term dividend growers….but again I have a greater proportion of my investments in ETFs.  

ETFs are like my main course meal and individual stocks are my side salad and dessert."

13,dividends,Thoughts on MED?,Discussion,"Right now I have a 5k portfolio with AAPL, MSFT, TXN, LOW and MED.

For my next 1k I am thinking of doubling my position in MED.

If there is any investor in MED, what do you think about it? My average cost is 106.55 and the metrics looks great. Good growth, share buybacks, dividend growth, impressive ROCE. I have been reading several SA articles and I do not see any reason why I should no invest more into that company.

Do you see any reason why not to concentrate more into that company?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/11pc55j/thoughts_on_med/,Because the MLM business model is garbage and has no moat.
